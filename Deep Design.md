This is a garden for farming ideas related to design, design practice, design pedagogy, and a critique of "Design Thinking" in the age of generative design. This is a hot mess, with big chunks still moving around all the time. You've been warned.

New ways of thinking, or newly considered old ways of thinking, are required.

- [[Deep Design, Defined]] Start here for the basic tenents. This isn't a manifesto.
- [[Discussions]]: Semi-regularly, we have meetings where we discuss topics in Deep Design.
- [[Documents]]: Practical documentation of the principles and practices of Deep Design
- [[Readings]]: relevant sources and historical precedent supporting Deep Design
- [[Experiments]]: a sandbox for projects exploring Deep Design

## Comments:
[[sparks, not bonfires]]
Practice is the aggregate of many process implementations, [[compiled knowledge]]
