>[!cite] "We are as gods, and we might as well get good at it."
— Stewart Brand, The Whole Earth Catalog

There has never been a time when an individual designer has been imbued with such creative power as we have at our fingertips today. The [[time to first prototype]] has never been shorter. And there have never been as many ways as there are today to interact collaboratively with team members, stakeholders, and users.
With great power comes great responsibility.
