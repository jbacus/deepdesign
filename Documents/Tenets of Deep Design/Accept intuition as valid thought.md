Trained designers are characterized by their ability to "know more than they can say."
This is sometimes confused with intuition, and with working in an intuitive way. But I don't think that is the right way to think about it. 

We (perhaps not without cause) have come to distrust intuitive thought because it tends to bias towards ideological bias. It is important to [[Acknowledge your ideology]] and know that it brings with it visible and invisible bias. Make that part of your practice of [[design research]] rather than using it as a crutch to get you to a conclusion faster.

A designer's intuition is something different, and it comes only after much research and experience. Consider the intuitive capabilities of a doctor in an emergency room, or a firefighter evaluating a burning house. To be truly effective, action without thinking is often required. In fact, it is usually characterized as the highest and best possible performance for those highly-trained professionals.

Designers, with time, research, and experience, can become capable of acting in similar ways, doing the right thing without necessarily being able to explain exactly why it was the right thing to do. When time is short (and when, realistically, is it _not?_), the best action to take is the most expedient one.

This way of acting and thinking is [[beware exhaustive research]]

Intuition might be an expression of the designer's [[default mode network]]
