All other design problems are automatable tasks that an AI can accomplish faster and more affordably. (Buchanan 1992)
"The *prompt* is the problem, the prompt is the *problem*."
Rather than asking if we have *solved* the problem, ask if the new problem is preferable to the old one. Are we increasing the benefits, or increasing the detriments? Better, not worse?
[[The universe is stranger than we can imagine]]
[[Wicked Problems]]
[[At a minimum, do more good than bad.]]
[[Design solutions worth working on are never complete.]]
