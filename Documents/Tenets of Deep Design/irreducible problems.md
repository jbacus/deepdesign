If [[Computational Irreducibility]] is a universal truth, could it be that [[Wicked Problems]] are evidence of irreducibility? The problem has unpredictable outcomes from a design perspective, with requirements that only become visible once the design has progressed to a place where it exposes them.

Deepening design is about finding the irreducible part of the problem. If you can solve that, you have really solved something.
