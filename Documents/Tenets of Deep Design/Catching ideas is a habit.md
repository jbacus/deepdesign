Like all habits, it takes time for them to settle in and become… habits. Practice catching ideas, practice every day. Measure how many ideas you can catch in a minute and see if you can beat today’s number tomorrow.

David Lynch describes ideas as being like fish, and the practice of catching them is like fishing in a big western river. At the beginning, you might not be very good at fishing. Maybe you think you need better gear, or you need to be sure you’re fishing in the right spot. But with time and practice, you can catch fish almost anywhere.
