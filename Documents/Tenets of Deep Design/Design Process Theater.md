Following a Design process with intention of showing that the process was followed... but without actually providing an outcome of value.

Executive mindsets like to know there is a process that can be followed to guaranteed success. This makes individuals on the team less important (more fungible) because anyone can play the role in the theatrical production so long as they stick to the lines.



# Warning Signs
Excessive specialization; teams with members that have unique titles that are very narrowly defined.

## Feature Team (Feature Factory)
Output-focused; list of features that are to be built, on a date, to a requirement
Measure: launches
Ubergoal: time-to-market

## Product Team
Outcome-focused; a project to solve, one or two per quarter
Measure: did the problem get solved?
Ubergoal: time-to-money
