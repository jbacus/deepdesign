Automation bias is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated [decision-making systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system "Decision support system") and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct.
"Automation Bias" people tend to favor decisions made through automation over decisions made by people, even when people seem to make better decisions.
Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role but able to make decisions. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic pilot to such mundane matters as the use of Spell-checking programs.
Could it be that people trust “news” in the same way? If the Facebook algorithm presents a story in one’s feed, does it inherently gain a level of trust that it doesn’t deserve?
