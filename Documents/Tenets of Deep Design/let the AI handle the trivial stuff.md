The commercialization of computation is primarily concerned with work automation. Everything that can be automates should be automated, and ultimately will be automated.
Not everything can be automated (see [[Computational Irreducibility]] for example. And [[@godelFormallyUndecidablePropositions1992]]), though.
Beware the bias that progress comes only through automation. By removing wickedness from problems, we can fool ourselves into believing that we have made more progress towards solving a problem than we might really have made.
Anything that can be handled computationally should be considered a trivial problem.
