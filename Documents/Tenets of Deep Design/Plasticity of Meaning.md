Derrida
Words have meaning only through contrast with other words; a triangle is meaningful only in an understanding of edges and angles; Triangles are differentiable from ovals, which do not have edges and angles.
THis is also a problem, though; binary opposition breeds contempt, asserts dominance, through difference, obe is better, one is worse
In Semiotics, a signifier has a signified
In Deconstruction, signifiers are only plastically associated with their signified (?)
