This phenomenon is often referred to as multiple discovery or simultaneous invention. It describes the occurrence when the same idea, innovation, or discovery emerges independently in different places around the same time. This happens because the conditions or knowledge base needed to make the discovery have matured to a point where multiple people or groups can arrive at the same conclusion.

Another term sometimes used is convergent evolution of ideas, which suggests that similar ideas evolve independently in different contexts due to similar conditions or needs.
