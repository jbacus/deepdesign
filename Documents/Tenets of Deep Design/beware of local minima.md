When seeking an optimal solution, it is possible to find a solution which suffices to solve the stated problem, even though there may yet be better solutions hiding nearby.

The [[Permanent Notes/Streetlight Problem]] is an example of a local minima. It may be even comically evident that a better solution might be found nearby, but the designer continues to look where it is easier to look.

[[Faster Horses]] are another example of a local minima [[Henry Ford, Innovation, and That “Faster Horse” Quote]]
