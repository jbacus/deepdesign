Thinking and doing must merge; by doing we achieve the laminar flow state between action and reflection. Ideas are cheap. Embrace outcomes over ideas. And yet, outcomes devoid of ideas are worth less as well.
[[Intuition is acknowledged as a pre-linguistic way of thinking]]
Ideas expressed without implementation are worse than useless. They make you feel like you've solved a problem... but you haven't even really begun.
An idea without an implementation is pretty to think about, but not real.
