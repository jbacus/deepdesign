Invented by IDEO in the mid-1980's, "Design Thinking" has become the dominant pattern for an idea development process that democratizes the essential act of "design" and makes it accessible outside traditional design practices.

As defined by IDEO, the Design Thinking process typically includes the following steps.

1. [[Lecture 3 - Empathy|Empathize]]
2. [[Lecture 4 - Define|Define]]
3. [[Lecture 5 - Ideate|Ideate]]
4. [[Lecture 6 - Prototype|Prototype]]
5. [[Lecture 7 - Test|Test]]

While Design Thinking processes are seemingly ubiquitous today, they are not without their critics. Like all such orthodoxies, the orthodox methodology has grown stale and perhaps delivered less of its original promise than expected. Rebecca Ackerman's 2023 article in the MIT Technology Review ("[[Literature Notes/Omnivore/2024-01-31/Design thinking was supposed to fix the world. Where did it go wrong- - MIT Technology Review|Design thinking was supposed to fix the world]]") noted this.

In [[Deep Design, Defined|deepdesign]], we acknowledge that design often resists orthodox methodology, and these are not steps in a linear process but perhaps rather nodes in a non-linear hypergraph. Still, mappings remain:

- Empathize -> [[practice of compassion]]
- Define -> [[practice of value]]
- Ideate -> [[practice of ideas]]
- Prototype -> [[practice of sketching]]
- Test -> [[practice of critique]]

And, critically, acknowledging that [[Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything.|ideas are cheap and execution is everything]], we add a sixth practice; a [[practice of launch]] to the graph.
