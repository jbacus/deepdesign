I, for one, welcome Generative AI as a design partner. Generative AI is a consensus machine and its inputs are always welcome. (reference?). Be better than an AI (it is easier than you think)   (Wolfram 2002) Generative AI raises the standards on what it means to be human.

"tell a story in the style of ernest hemmingway"

The sun had just risen over the rugged mountains in the distance, casting a soft golden glow on the small fishing village below. The sea was calm and quiet, with only the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore to break the silence.

Santiago had been up for hours, his weathered hands working methodically as he repaired his fishing net. He was an old man, but he still went out to sea every day, determined to catch the biggest fish he could.

Today, he had a feeling that it would be a good day. The sky was clear, and the sea was calm - perfect conditions for fishing. He gathered his gear and set out in his small boat, the wooden oars creaking as he rowed out to deeper waters.

For hours, he cast his line and waited patiently, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. But it seemed as though the sea was empty today, devoid of any life.

Just as he was about to give up and head back to shore, he felt a tug on his line. It was a strong, powerful pull, and he knew immediately that he had hooked a big one.

For hours, he battled with the fish, his muscles aching and his hands blistered from the strain. But he refused to give up, determined to catch the biggest fish of his life.

Finally, as the sun began to set on the horizon, Santiago pulled the fish into his boat. It was a marlin, the biggest he had ever seen, and he felt a surge of pride and triumph course through his veins.

As he rowed back to shore, the weight of the fish heavy in his boat, Santiago knew that he had achieved something great. He was an old man, but he still had the strength and determination to conquer the sea and catch the biggest fish of his life.
