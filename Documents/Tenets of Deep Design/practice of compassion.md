A practice of compassion centers on heartfelt understanding of humans and the problems they face. Through compassion, opportunities to make an improvement on the world (the fundamental design act) become visible.

As practiced by capitalistic Design Thinking, “empathy” is a tool which is used to expose traits in “users” that can be exploited for financial profit. Problems are an opportunity for financial gain. A practice of compassion acknowledges all human need in the space of consideration.

in design teams,  
  
there are internal challenges,  
internal challenges are of two types:  
  
01. team dynamics (what happens because of outside factors)  
> organisational behaviour  
> societal pressure  
  
02. need for validation (what happens because of inside factors)  
> pyramid of needs  
> to be alpha  
  
an honest design is inversely proportional to the impact of these parameters in a team.  
  
Interestingly, designers are exposed to better life styles and better products, they end up in having high levels of these factors.  
  
  
Two things:  
01. Strength to let go (Dispassion called Vairagya in Sanskrit)  
02. Understanding of what truly matters (Discrimination called Viveka in Sanskrit (ability to discriminate what is temporary and what is long term))  
  
These two helps in coming out of small goals to bigger goals.  
  
Ego is good.  
Ego wakes us every day and bring us to office, so that we should be financially independent.  
Ego makes us to take good care of the kids, so that people say his/her kids is so good  
Ego makes us to work hard  
  
Small ego brings misery  
Big ego brings happiness  
  
Big ego cultivates compassion!  
  
How can the person who is buying the product i design face an issue? i won't let it happen!  
How can competitor's team can think of better solution than us? We can't let this happen!  
  
All inclusive ego helps us to come out of the internal challenges mentioned above, and helps us to think about users being unbiased. and it results in the designs which they wanted, not designs which we need to solve the internal issues.
