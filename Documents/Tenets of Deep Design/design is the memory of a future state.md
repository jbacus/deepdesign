Describing design or innovation as “the memory of a remembered future” is a poetic way of emphasizing the visionary aspect of creating something new. This phrase suggests that designers and innovators tap into a vision of the future so vivid it feels like a memory—they “remember” what doesn’t yet exist.

Here’s what this means:

	1.	Envisioning the Future: Designers and innovators often anticipate future needs, trends, or problems. They create solutions not just for the present but for a future state that they foresee.
	2.	Bringing the Future into the Present: By treating these future visions as “memories,” they work to make them a reality. It’s as if they’re recalling a future that is so clear and detailed, it can be translated into tangible designs or innovations today.
	3.	Intuitive Insight: This concept also touches on intuition and imagination. It implies that there’s an inherent understanding or insight into what the future holds, allowing creators to design with that end state in mind.
	4.	Bridging Time: The phrase blurs the line between the present and the future, suggesting that innovation is a process of connecting the two—using “memories” of the future to inform actions in the present.

In essence, to describe design or innovation this way highlights the forward-thinking and almost prophetic role that creators play. They don’t just react to the present; they anticipate and shape the future by bringing their “memories” of it into the world.
