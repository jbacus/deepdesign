An idea garden is the place where all raw ideas go to see if they can find friends and grow into something bigger and better over time.

When you have an idea, write it down here. Capture should be effortless, should be simple, and always available.
The garden should be safe, and should be trusted. Never worry that an idea, once planted, will be lost.
Ideas that don't work for one project might work for another. Compost them for future grows.
