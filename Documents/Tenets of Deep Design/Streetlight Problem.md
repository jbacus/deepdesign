Beware of streetlights

202306081608
The streetlight problem drives away from innovation, away from deep solutions (Nagaraj, Manso, and Tranchero, n.d.); beware automation bias; there are truths that cannot be automated (computational irreducibility)

*"A recent work by Hoelzemann et al. (2022) is close in spirit to this paper: using a laboratory experiment, the authors document the “streetlight” effect of data,24 that when data reveals a satisfactory—but not the best—option, data can discourage workers from exploring further to reach the best."*
