Celebrate failures; don't punish them. Failures show you that you know where the limits of the design are. Successes only show you some safe data point in the middle. (Voronoi diagram of solution space?) (Edison and his 7,000 failures). 
Instead, punish safe inaction. Punish behavior that stays too narrowly between the lines. Explore off-road.
[[Embraces failure as knowledge of things that don't work (Edison)]]
