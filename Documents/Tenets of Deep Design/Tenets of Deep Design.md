The Tenets of Deep Design include:
- [[practice of compassion]]
- [[practice of value]]
- [[practice of ideas]]
- [[practice of sketching]]
- [[practice of critique]]
- [[practice of launch]]

Linear methodologies like [[Design Thinking]] are but one of many paths through the practice of deep design. In fact, they may be the best possible places to start. With time, and after much practice, the formulaic code of design thinking may be compiled into new, instinctive ways of design.
