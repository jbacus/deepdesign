In the [[Agile Manifesto]], progress is shown through continuous, regular, delivery of value. A practice of Deep Design is of no lasting value without the delivery of tangible assets which lead to attainment of design goals. It is of more value to solve a problem than it is to define the problem, than it is to acknowledge the problem exists and to understand it deeply.

A launch might take many different forms, from the delivery of a polished asset, to a simple pitch of a new idea in an elevator.
