In the [[Agile Manifesto]], progress is shown through continuous, regular, delivery of value. A practice of Deep Design is of no lasting value without the delivery of tangible assets which lead to attainment of design goals. It is of more value to solve a problem than it is to define the problem, than it is to acknowledge the problem exists and to understand it deeply.

A launch might take many different forms, from the delivery of a polished asset, to a simple pitch of a new idea in an elevator.

[[Deep Design is never complete]], and every designer is [[always polishing, never finished]]. [[Always be ready to demo]], [[Always be ready to show your work]]. [[Deep Design solutions are never complete.]], but that means it is also always complete to the point where it is right now.

[[At a minimum, do more good than bad.]]
