Make as many ideas as you can, all the time. Write them down immediately, review them later, then review them again and again. Every time you re-read a note, you deepen your understanding of the concept it represents, and encode it in your memory in a deeper way.

[[Innovation is a habit]] and [[Ideaflow]] is a way to measure it. How fast can you make new ideas?

willingness to be surprised, willingness to be delighted. Also, willingness to be disapointed or even horrified. If we only want predictable outcomes, we will remain forever under the streetlight.

[[Innovation is a habit]], [[You need good habits]]. [[Get up early and stay up late]].
[[Daydreaming is work]]. [[You know more than you can say]] [[Accept intuition as valid thought]]
[[You need a setup]]. [Keep notes all the time]]. [[Get a sketchbook and sketch in it]]. [[Commonplace Book]] [[Mathematica Notebook]], [[Idea Garden]]
[[Big things have small beginnings]]. [[Embrace indeterminacy]]. [[memory is constructive]]. [[design is the memory of a future state]]
[[Celebrate obstruction]]. [[Throw most of your ideas away]]
[[Throw your first idea away]]
[[Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate]]. [[simultaneous invention]] [[Distrust authorship]] [[ideas want to be free]]

[[The Charette is coming]]

[[Creativity is learning the rules of an unknown future]]. Innovation is the act of bringing that remembered future state into existence?

[[how memory works]]

This is the practice of openness to new ideas;  [[hot ideas]], [[cold ideas]], [[entropic ideas]]

The [[practice of innovation is like breathing]]. 

[[Accept intuition as valid thought]]
[[Acknowledge your ideology]]
[[Beware of hidden impossibilities]]
[[Streetlight Problem]]
[[Snowballing Effect]]
[[Deep Design allows Intuition]]

beware of [[Innovation Theater]]
tune into your [[default mode network]]
[[Intuition is acknowledged as a pre-linguistic way of thinking]]

[[false innovation]]

[[My idea is now your idea]]
[[as many ideas as possible]]
diverging and converging is like breathing; inhaling problems and opportunities, exhaling solutions and ideas.

[[Faster Horses]] is an error condition in innovation. [[the user is always right]]
