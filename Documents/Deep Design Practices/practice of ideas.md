Without ideas we can't do anything. Innovation comes only after catching an idea, developing it, studing it and forming it. We don't know where they come from; they can come from anywhere. But we can attune ourselves to be better receivers of them when they come. We can exercise responsibility in caring for them gently, nurturing them, and helping them grow.

Make as many ideas as you can all the time. When you catch an idea, write it down immediately. Never let it escape, even if it seems incomplete, silly, irrelevant, or impractical. Capture everything in some simple and trustworthy system. You’ll come back to it later.

When time permits, review your notes and see what further ideas are triggered. Can you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the idea down? Every time you re-read a note, you deepen your understanding of the concept it represents and encode it in your memory in a deeper way. [[Memory is constructive| Memory is constructive]] and ideas reshape every time we think of them again. Embrace that.

[[Catching ideas is a habit]], and [[you need good habits]]. Be prepared to [[get up early and stay up late]]. Like most habits, having a way to measure provides a baseline and a way to judge how much you are improving. [[Ideaflow]] is one way to measure it. How fast can you make new ideas? How fast can you make new ideas as a team? Remove the filters, defer the critique, how much faster can you go?

Followers of a practice of ideas show willingness to be surprised, willingness to be delighted. Also, willingness to be disapointed or even horrified. If we only want predictable outcomes, we will remain forever under the [[ATLAS/deepdesign/Documents/Tenets of Deep Design/Streetlight Problem|streetlight.]] We must [[Embrace indeterminacy|embrace indeterminacy]] and allow unexpected leaps to lead us somewhere… unexpected.

Leonard Cohen said, “If I knew where all the good songs came from, I would go there more often.” Those experienced in the practice of ideas know how to be prepared when ideas swim by, and they know how to put themselves in the place where the ideas are quickly and efficiently. They don’t necessarily know where all the good songs are… but they know how to get there when they need to.

All ideas seem to come from other ideas, and there is nothing truly novel in the world. The fact that [[memory is constructive]] seems to contribute to the additive nature of a practice of ideas. A small idea draws other related ideas in to adjacency, building idea on idea until something new is recognized. [[Big ideas have small beginnings]] and it is easy to miss the most subtle of thoughts unless you are carefully attentive.

[[Daydreaming is work]] though to those who don’t know, this seems counterintuitive. And yet, how often have you had a great idea come only when you are concentrating all your attention on willing it to come? Daydreaming activates the brain’s [[default mode network]], which lights up the brain like a christmas tree. Ideas flutter by all the time, but it is only when your mind is truly open that you can receive them.

[[Celebrate obstruction]], and learn that [[failures are a gift]]. Be prepared to [[Throw most of your ideas away]]. [[The First Idea is Usually the Worst Idea]]. [[Throw your first idea away]]. Obstructions tell you where ideas don’t belong- file them away for some future problem where they are a better fit.

With practice, intuition is trained to produce leaps of insight rather than simple preconception that does nothing more than expose hidden bias. A [[schonReflectivePractitionerHow1984a|reflective practitioner]] is one who has compiled a wide body of knowledge and experience and is able to make snap decisions that demonstrate that they [[You know more than you can say|know more than they can say]]. A practice of ideas [[Accept intuition as valid thought|accepts intuition as deep thought]] and knows that rigor sometimes follows intuition.

Consider [[mccarthyKekuleProblem2017a|the “Kekulé Problem”]] if the above statement makes your rational self uncomfortable. Scientists and mathematicians have known for hundreds of years that there are deeper forms of thinking than the language-locked cognition that feels so logical. August Kekulé, when stumped by the geometric problem of benzene, had a dream- a mythical dream about the Oroboros. When he awoke, he knew that benzene was a ring.

In a practice of ideas, [[design is the memory of a future state]], constructed meticulously but at the same time intuitively. [[About Me/My Projects/Digital Sketching/Creative Rigor in Design|Creative rigor]] is difficult to audit, perhaps, but it is apparent when in absence. In the practice of ideas, we may not be able to say how we know, but we know we are right and experience will prove that out. [[Creativity is learning the rules of an unknown future]]. Innovation is the act of bringing that remembered future state into existence?

When the practice of ideas connects with the [[practice of critique]] it becomes quickly apparent that we are [[better when we work together]]. No single designer can know everything that there is to know about a problem, and ideas from one mind readily spark ideas in another. Through communication and storytelling, we improve upon what we know in the most impactful ways. As communication channels proliferate and the daily bandwidth across our culture increases, this becomes more and more true. The density of our connections make it increasingly difficult to claim unique authorship for any idea. Examples of [[simultaneous invention]] abound. We should learn to [[Distrust authorship]] as a means of control on the practice of ideas. [[Ideas want to be free]]. [[Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate]]!

Uniqueness, where it manifests, belongs instead to the [[practice of value]].

## Design Thinking‘s [[Lecture 5 - Ideate|”Ideate”]] step
In Design Thinking methodologies, we teach practices that are effective at capturing ideas and moving them up and down in abstraction. Ideas are sorted, stacked, clustered, and restated. Ideas are shared, presented, and stowed for future action. But what is always missing in the literature is an essential practice of catching ideas in the first place. A notable absence, I think.

Process-following activities engage the brain’s executive mode, which causes the default mode network to disengage. Ironic, isn’t it, that precisely the activity that leads us to believe we are responsibly ideating is the one that might well actually turn your brain’s most creative mode off.
