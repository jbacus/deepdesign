A practice of value recognizes the necessity of profit in any endevor whose pursuit requires an expense of resource. In our late-stage capitalist era, financial gain is the easiest and most portable metric by which value is measured, but it is by no means the only way that we might bring value to the world.

Delight is the root of all lasting value. Find delight.

[[At a minimum, do more good than bad.]]
