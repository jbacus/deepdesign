# Brainstorming is prevalent and powerful.

…but where do the ideas it aims to capture come from in the first place?

# a Taxonomy of Ideas
- hot ideas
- cold ideas
- entropic ideas
---
# Hot
A hot idea comes through a flash of inspiration, apparently from nowhere. The thrill of discovery is heightened as observable patterns that support the idea manifest. The idea grows, bursting into existence, and the designer cannot think about anything else. Hot ideas are explosive... and sometimes short-lived.

---
# Cold
A cold idea is one that comes slowly, haltingly, over a long period of time. It is often the result of rigorous exploration and brute-force trial and error. Cold ideas are often seeds for something bigger to follow, arriving only in disconnected sequence over many long months or even years of attention.

---
# Entropic
Entropic ideas spring into existence simultaneously from the same background radiation at multiple points. Authorship is collective and has an inevitable quality to it. An entropic idea represents the lowest energy state in a solution space, where problems and opportunities are widely understood.
