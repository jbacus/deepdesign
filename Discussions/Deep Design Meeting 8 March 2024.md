# Summary
This conversation spans a wide range of topics, from the nature of creativity and the impact of technology on art and design to the philosophical underpinnings of artificial intelligence and its role in society. It touches upon the work of Andy Warhol and his exploration of reproduction and aura in art, the concept of hyperpop music as a reflection of media saturation and short attention spans, and the potential of AI and generative tools to both mimic and extend human creativity.

The discussion also delves into the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of ideas, people, and technologies, as exemplified by the internet and AI's ability to aggregate and synthesize vast amounts of information. This leads to a reflection on the nature of individual creativity versus collective intelligence, the role of education in fostering a balance between systematic learning and imaginative thinking, and the potential for new forms of collaboration and creation in the digital age.

The conversation suggests a bibliography that could include works on art, technology, and philosophy, ranging from Andy Warhol's explorations of pop art to Paul Graham's essays on hackers and painters, discussions on the nature of software and creativity, and the implications of AI and network theory on contemporary culture and creativity.

In essence, your dialogue captures a moment of transition and reflection on how digital technologies, particularly AI, are reshaping our understanding of creativity, collaboration, and the very nature of human thought. It raises questions about the future of education, the role of the individual creator in a networked world, and the potential for AI to both replicate and augment human creativity in ways that challenge traditional notions of authorship and artistic genius.

# Raw Transcription
With Andy Warhol, who made reproduction-driven art. Yeah, it goes back to this whole thing, right? Like taking the idea of reproduction and Thinking about the movies he made, right? Yeah, it's the ultimate de-skilled movie. Yeah, super, watch somebody sleep for the cameras. Just put on a stack of books or something like they probably didn't even have a tribute. He was also very interested in Kool and the use of Kool as part of his whole artistic statement. So it's... Well, you used the terms vibe and the Kool. Are those just synonyms? for the aura? I think, in some ways, because I... So if you have a mechanically reproduced thing, but you put it in, you know, it's at the factory, in an art gallery, on the front cover of a fashion magazine. Yeah. So now it has a different aura. Its bold colors are particular. I chose the sizing, the colors, the subject matter, and all those combos to reinvent graphic design as this bold thing and like the album cover. The Velvet Underground album cover is a huge part of the aura. So, Andy Warhol puts his thumbprint on it. Yeah. I mean, that's what I think the kids out here are tied into: these dense patterns of overlapping symbols depend on how branding works, but it's like you put a Nike swoosh. Next to a particular Naruto character doing some pose, does that mean you know something? It's very mysterious what it means, so the street fashion kind of stuff with its symbolism, I would say, comes out of that same, yeah, and the access to it. There's so much today. People are getting better at absorbing and processing things. Still, I wonder if there is something about that, just the sheer quantity of images, symbols, stuff, memes, and ephemera. A lot of what we're doing is processing all that. So what's the what's the seminal work in there? Is there a book? Is there a thinker? Is there there a movie? I mean, we've said Warhol. Yeah, I feel like there is something more recent. It exemplifies this as media overwhelm. Also, there's hyper pop, a sub-subgenre of music that's like, if you listen, you'd be like, this is wild. It's like hurting my brain. Very in, like digitally in the red. intentionally, it's a million miles an hour. The songs are about one and a half minutes. It's all wild, like left turns constantly, all that kind of stuff like lots of broken jankiness like weird voices and all that stuff, and it seems in my mind to represent something of the mindset of like the infinite scrolling and Short attention span like everything everywhere everything. Yeah. Yeah. Let me try to shift it, so what's the counterpoint to that again? So media saturation and, you know, the culture of images, MTV, I remember MTV. Um, I want to; I love the hackers and painters essay. I feel like there's something significant in there. Um, have you read that one? you know that one. So Paul Graham wrote an essay called "Hackers and Painters." Big ideas for the computer age. So I think his shtick is that he did; he was a computer scientist, and he earned a master's and a graduate degree. Did he get a PhD? Who knows? Anyway, advanced study. Well, before Y Combinator, he was... He had a programming language called ARC. ARC, yeah. Didn't he do wikis? That could be... Anyway, after he got his engineering degree, he went to art school and got a painting degree. In the first paragraph of the essay, he basically says that... he felt that computer programming had more in common with painting than it had in common with engineering. Reasonable gist of the essay, and then he goes on to, you know, prove that point. I wrote another essay about or read about it but didn't write it. Mark Bernstein wrote it, you know, Mark Bernstein, Story Space, Eastgate Systems, really into hypertext. Yeah, sort of. Maybe. He's in Boston. Yeah, okay. Bastard. But he wrote an essay about artisanal software. I think that even it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, He wrote an essay about artisanal software, actually I think it even... expand it to a book. Artisanal software is the opposite of production-hardened Microsoft Office applications built by acres of programmers. Yeah, so I used to use Tinderbox. Tinderbox is cool. Have you ever played with that? Unfortunately, I gave it up because it has to-- well, that's a longer story. But Tinderbox is incredibly distinctive. It's a mind-mapping thought process. outlining, note gathering, sorting. It's sort of a tool that's pretty unique. It's mysterious for anybody except those who think like that. Man, if you do, it is brilliant. Frickin' brilliant.offscreen Gingerbox, huh? Yeah.offscreen And down to the list. It's, it's... Right, but the point of it... The point is that, is there another way of thinking about software which is more like painting or, you know, the work of an artisan? Sure. I mean, that's what I champion all the time, right? It's hacking. It's not a building. We're not teaching people to write production software. We shouldn't. They go to school. for that minute. But we are teaching people to use the software as a vehicle for thinking or having ideas. Another in this mapping software to art is Dick Gabriel, which I mentioned before Dream Songs. He was a brilliant programmer who started a Software company quite successfully and then went on to write, became a writer, got an MFA in writing, and saw the writer rooms writers. Okay, keep going. Then he fell in love with Alexander, and so pattern languages. There's also this parallel pattern language that came from architecture by Chris Alexander. Still, the whole software community said, Oh, software patterns and then UI patterns, And again, there are these crossovers. I don't know why I'm off on this, but he mentioned the Hackers and Painters essay that says that He talks about Alexander in that essay, doesn't he? I don't know who. Paul Graham. I don't remember. Richard Gabriel? Yeah, dreamsongs.com. I like how 90s this website looks. this website looks. Well, it's it's that generation. Yeah, Even though there's some new stuff or stuff from 2022, at least I've been having this last year's series of conversations with my daughter. So, you know, she's just having a great semester. She's finally got into the senior-level classes. So she read, you know, she read this cyborg manifesto like two weeks ago. Oh, now we're going, but I keep trying to get her to tell me, like, what's something that's happened in the last ten years that's relevant to you instead of talking about all this stuff from the, you know, the 50s, the 60s 70s 80s And I suppose it's maybe the wrong room to ask that too, but. So, I don't know. I had this flash of a thought of what feels different now. I think you might have said something about building, well, like building a website. I don't know that, or maybe I was thinking that. If you make a website now, and you want anyone to see it, you have to make it based on Google search, And so you have to make a shitty website now. If you'd like people to see it, that's pretty big, but do you want to? Why do you make music? Well, not. I mean, making music and making a website to talk about my music and how, hopefully, people can find the website is more of a functional thing. Okay, the point is that there are all these dictated things from above now that so clearly, like, create. very commoditized or like specific designs and forms that you can make your crazy website, but no one will be able to find it now. I had a conversation about this with my daughter as well. She's now my go-to reference resource. She's having a great semester. She and her partner have clothing, like a fashion company they've been working on. They buy, they upcycle stuff from thrift stores, and they, you know, this is, Dyke Mint is the name of the company. If you're interested, you will immediately type that into a search engine of your choice. Yahoo. I do DuckDuckGo. Then you realize you don't find stakes. Yeah. It's pretty fun. Yeah. That website is not how they talk to any other customers. It's never updated. It's probably a year old. The stuff that they're talking about on that site is long sold. everything is on Instagram, and I said, "Lito, why do you use Instagram? Social media is going to kill you. You know that, right?" She says, "Well, yeah, I don't use it. I, you know, that's for marketing." So, yeah. Are these all one-of-a-kind? Uh-huh. Sometimes, they do additions of three. Hmm. So, they sell it on Instagram? They don't even have to? They sell it on Instagram. I went to a comic convention two weekends ago and made $15,000 selling t-shirts. Very proud of my daughter. - Yeah, I mean, that's just, yeah. Do they like silkscreen all this? Or like, how do, damn. - Yeah, airbrushes and spray paint. - Well, and I think, I mean, that's. A good example is using the system but also saying F you to the system in some ways, and it's not, then you're not selling like drop ship; it looks cool. Still, when you get it, like the joke of, yeah, it's a little bit deploying, deflating you thought you were getting and what you got by or buying the thing. on Amazon or Instagram or whatever, it's like, you get it, and it's just garbage, but it looks cool. Like this is the opposite of that where like what is this and then it's this handmade upcycled real thing one of a kind. But I think what they're taking advantage of is, you know, it's again the aura, the uniqueness. precisely because only one of those exists in the world, and there's a pair of overalls on there that are priced at $1,500. Someone's going to buy it. Someone will buy it. It hasn't been bought yet. There's a hoodie for $515. They sold two $700 jackets at this convention. So people... I think I crave that aura. Personalized. Yeah, personalized. I'm making fun of him. The event he just went to is about personalized education. I went to, I mean, it was personalized engineering learning. There was a whole trend. it over the past ten years. I've died out with marketing automation, where it's all about personalized marketing experiences. When it was just like, "Dear Mark," in the email. That was kind of my... Mail merge. Yeah. A keychain with your initials on it and your monogrammed napkins. Yeah. Well, what's the best... I mean, to know what came out of that conference, but what's the best kind of education? I mean, I'd say like an apprenticeship, right? Or one-on-one mentorship? Maybe not apprenticeship. I don't know if that's the right term, but you know. the deepest of students with whom I had independent study. Yeah, no, apprenticeship is an amazing learning experience, an educational experience. I'm not sure why we're... But it doesn't scale. So there's a unique quality to that as well, right? There's an aura on your education in a sense that you didn't sit in front of a video tutorial or... Or even maybe an AI tutor that's teaching you, I don't know, Duolingo, right, it's going to teach you how to speak Italian, wouldn't it be better to hang out with an old Italian guy and drink a lot of coffee and smoke some cigarettes or something? Did you learn Italian better that way? Real Italian. Right, but that's the aura. In one specific village, you can only speak to about 150 people. But you're in. Yeah, you're in. You're family. But I think in programming, that's the thing. I mean, I've seen it professionally that, you know, the best way to onboard somebody into a big, complex software engineering project is to sit them next to the most senior. member of the team and have them chit-chat all day long. I've had this sense among friends and, like in the media, that people in companies are going, "I don't know what anything is, what it all means, even exists, why everyone's getting fired around me? Yes, none of what I do has any purpose or meaning, and it's like there's we're in this weird state of flux right now, and I'm curious about, you know, looking at students, because they're not, they don't have that yet, because they're not, they're still in the like, we can do all this weird, crazy stuff because it's not my job. I can do whatever I want with it. Like looking at that as some sort of, what do we do with all this? I've heard a critique of the use of generative AIs in, let's say, the marketing department of a large corporation, that you tend to use the AI to write copy for things that are of lesser importance or, you know, they're earlier in the process, you need a first draft. You might have used an intern. or kind of a freshling team member to do that previously, and now you don't need that person. So, how do those people get the experiences they need to improve their skills? Well, it makes you think that the AI can't improve at some point because it will only be referenced. Eventually, it isn't enjoyable. It's eating its tail. There's a term for that, isn't there? The eventuality is when we begin training AI on the output of AI. It's already happening. It sort of recursively. Self-referential. Yeah. It seems like there was a name for that. It'll just start being put out by now. I know, I know, I know, I know. Of my favorites, I don't know if this is apropos what exactly, but one of my favorite AI experiments is this thing called the infinite conversation, which is a deep fake of Werner Herzog talking to a deep fake of Slavoj Zizek. They go back and forth, and they're actually... But their accents are so important. I know. So they deepfaked the accents as well. Yeah, and so, you know, the Herzog bot will say something Herzog-ish, you know, and then the Zizek bot will take that as a prompt and then generate something Zizek-ish, you know, back, and it's just, I think, been chattering at itself for... Who knows how long it's been up? I discovered it maybe two years ago, and it's still making something new every time I go there. But isn't there a funny moment when AI starts talking to AI's doing... I mean, I can imagine... Oh, there was another experiment that was a Google... So it was the little voice-activated pucks. Someone set up two or three of them talking to each other so that the Alexa bot would talk to the Google bot, and the way they got it going back and forth was about calendar invites and trying to schedule a meeting. It's one of the worst, most terrible things humans must do. so why not get an AI to do that? But then, do we end up with these things locked in these AI death matches? You know, they never resolve. I heard a comedian refer to eating an oyster as a briny nothing, which I loved. You just kind of, it's like this like, it's so... sophisticated fancy it's a salty nothing I love that description, and so much of this feels like that it's like, oh there's a little bit of flavor, and it's just and it's gone it has so diminished particle or I mean I I've been in so many presentations that tremble specifically where You know, some mid-tier executive has discovered chat GPT, and they've used it to make a slide deck to pitch some idea. I will send my AI to the next meeting so that I can listen to that presentation and summarize it. Yeah, yeah. like Peter's rehearsal, the LD's bot showed up. So there's some transcription and conference transcription software. Once you subscribe to the free version, they check what's on your calendar and meeting invite, and they show up and say I'm LD's bot. I'm coming here to attend the meeting, and they will generate the conversation transcript. LD didn't... She did not even know that Barney showed up. She said she was trying for different transcriptions because she has recorded workshops and wanted to find free transcription. By the way, I used media transcription to transcribe the whole thing for the Chinese things I did. The other reference that I haven't read in a long time is Nicholas Carr's The Shallows. Is Google making us stupid? It was an Atlantic article, and then it turned into a book. The Shallows was the article in The Atlantic. Is Google making us dumb? What the internet is doing to our brains is the name of the book, The Shallows. The internet is doing to our brains, yeah. - Actually, he lived here for a while. - I think that generative AI is probably doing that even worse. - Well, that's why I mentioned it. So, I'm a little lost as to why this is an interesting but widely-ranging conversation. I'm not sure whether there's a-- - I'm capturing; what I'm doing is getting refs. references. So, the output that I would want from this is a bibliography. So essentially, what I'm trying to decode is the canon. The canon of what? The deep design of generative AI? Yeah. You're skeptical. No, I mean, I'm just like... The list will be too long. Yeah, I don't know what... Filtered out. I don't know what filter to use. Yeah, well, it's interesting because many of them know where to begin to get anywhere the original articles you mentioned. The people who like the Sam Altman's of the world probably read all that or were familiar with that stuff and Filtered it into what they Outputted, and now we have the outputs; it's like, I don't know what I'm trying to say, but there's something about like, all that stuff gets left behind, and we all we have is like this flood of, we've created these things that flood us with like simulacra of that stuff or something or like, I mean, is Baudrillard on the list? I think the fact that you put one of the articles into a large language is probably funny and ironic, as well as dark and weird. I don't even know if it's dark. I mean, I think it might be. If I had a particular subgenre inside of deep design, it would be something around language. and you know, is that the way we structure thought, or is language the thought? Right? So, is a large language model thinking, or is it not thinking? I think that would be an exciting long project to work on. Plenty of people are doing that. But why don't I try to summarize what I have got here? So I think we've been interested. in things about artistic, creative acts and the making of unique things with an aura. We're interested in maybe the processes around. Are you making a unique thing? Or are you making a system that makes unique things? So, the generative part of generative AI is that it's a system that makes uniqueness. That is an interesting long question about whether there's an aura to that or not. Does it make uniqueness? So I would claim, so Brian, you know, I would claim the Brian Eno generative music pieces are making uniqueness. Well, okay. There is this idea that all the ideas in the world have always existed. He makes background music. Yeah, that's his intention. Yeah. So it's intentionally like, "Meh, here it is." He was also in Roxy Music, a fundamental band that made a lot of background music. He did, you know, U2, and yeah, so it's, I think he, he makes like, this is very much like an artistic experiment. Rather than him saying, this is the future of music; this is what all music should be. Yeah. But when we got to like hackers and painters, I mean, again, that's the theme: are we doing something like an artisan? Are we doing something that generates a sense of authenticity, something unique? I don't know the dream songs, I don't know dream songs well enough to summarize that, but we were talking about pattern languages, so a pattern is, in a sense, another way of talking about, could you say it's a kind of automation of design in the sense of... I will hold the position of designer and artist and always proceed according to a system. They're not just generating uniqueness for the sake of uniqueness. So if you look at the work of-- pick your artist. , over their-- career, their system may change, but each work of art, whether it's music, dance, or painting, is an instance produced by their system. Now, they may not be explicitly aware of the system. They may not describe the system per se, but that's what's happening. Right, Andy Warhol always takes photographs. that puts it on a piece of paper. - However, whatever it is. - Yeah, yeah. - And so making, whether the person makes this or the person makes a machine that does this, if they can put their system into a machine that doesn't denigrate or depress the value of the making. It's just a different means of making. I think I was skeptical of using AI to be part of your system or the output generator of your system, and some, I will, people are going to prove me wrong, but there's something about it. All of the work, okay, Warhol made it very production-driven- he had a factory. He had a factory. Yeah. But he also was a production artist who drew shoes for a living for years. Illustrator. Illustration, yeah. In a, for sales and marketing materials. Because he got to the point of his system through a long process, much work was involved, and not necessarily intentional thought at every step. You're doing the thing and must keep doing it repeatedly. Does AI skip over lots of steps to get you much further along? In a way that, like... Or is it... So, there's a lot of generative AI positioning in human-computer interactions. action, which is, it's like your buddy, it's your sidekick, it's your co-pilot, they always use the term co-pilot, right, so, you know, your Gemini, your twin, your Gemini, exactly, they use that name too. So, if Andy Warhol was alive today, would Andy have an Andy bot? would. He totally would, right? But if Andy Warhol, age 21, not even a production artist, was like, "AI, AI, I'm using AI. No one would care." I don't know, maybe not, but he got it. I mean, he was such a spectacle just in society. His persona, yeah. But he also likes outputted real stuff. I guess I'm hung up on it; I'm pulling my brain in different ways. I think that notion of... Okay, so I take the critique that we're not discussing unique artistic output. Maybe that isn't what we want to have as an outcome. I like the aura. People like the aura, but are we... There was only a short period in art history when artwork was the singular product of a single person. I mean, it was like all religious and political portraits, and then unsigned something happened right and now and then we had, you know, I don't know what 100 years of singular artist artistic genius 200 years has it been maybe I think I think I'm getting hung up on the use of language in AI and to your point of like a guitar that is the interface for communicating with AI, I don't think of it that way because it doesn't exist yet. I think of it as articulating my desire to create a thing with words, which is extremely strange. Okay, there is an example. An example of an instrument that Morton Sobotnick, an electronic music pioneer, used to perform with these is called the ghost score. Do you know about these? So it was an analog device that he would play an instrument into the device, and then it would do like an envelope follow, and it would just make some other sound, right? But he would make a noise, and it would make a noise in response to that noise, and then he would feed back and forth. So, it was a way of performing with a machine. It's not artificial intelligence; it's an analog device. you know, to this, I'm sure now, there are plenty of, I guess reactor was probably built with that in mind. Reaktor, the-- - Is that the pad? - I'm thinking software, but. - Yeah. - Native Instruments, maybe Reaktor. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that is, yeah. R-E-A-K-T-O-R. - With a K, yeah. hung up on having to explicitly describe verbally something that doesn't, that you don't feel or see as naturally verbal. Sure. Well, the process is not verbal. The process of making a song or a painting is not verbal. I would love to go deeper into that, and I think it's relevant to... you know, the manifesto of design. We're not writing a manifesto. But, you know, acknowledging there are non-linguisttic ways of thinking, and if thinking, then creating and designing. In my class, I talked about the distortion Kekulé problem, that August Kekulé was the guy that Kekulé, I don't know how to pronounce it right. Yeah, you mean the snail. The benzene ran. Yeah, so, the Ouroboros. The question was, is there a substance called benzene, and what is its molecular structure? And they didn't know, and he was working on the problem and fell asleep in front of the fire, woke up, and had this dream about a worm eating its tail, and that's a circle, and that's the benzene ring. So the interesting point of this is that that's a great way to solve the problem, but when he was having the dream, why didn't his dream self say to him, "Hey, Kekule, this is how it works. It's a ring, and, you know, it's carbons and hydrogen." And this is more or less the arrangement. Okay, you got it. Okay, wake up. Yeah, no, but instead, he had like this mythical dream, Yeah, with an image, But that was enough that when he woke up, it triggered the thought, So one of the most interesting people at this workshop that I just workshop whatever was meeting that I went to was a chemical engineer from of Alabama, Birmingham, who also has a psychedelics company in Canada, and the question was could psychedelics help personalized engineering learning because it clears your mind or puts you in a different state. Okay. NSF's going to fund that. Interesting. Is NSF going to fund it? Well, they probably should. I'm surprised I haven't yet. But what I particularly like about that story is that it demonstrates what should be considered hard science, right? With clear, practical value, the discovery of the benzene ring was enormously important. But it came from this peculiar, mythical place, and so it wasn't verbal language, it wasn't, you know, utterances, it wasn't written language, it wasn't, you know... explains how the scientific method is prescribed. - Yeah, and yet it led to a precious scientific sort of outcome, and I think as a follow-on to that story, that's not uncommon. That kind of way of thinking, I think, is in art and architecture schools. and music schools, I think we tend to train people who are capable of thinking in non-linguistic ways. Well, I think it's both. So, I think if Kekulé had not been trained in the rigors of chemistry the way it had been practiced, this dream would have been worthless to them. It would have been a dream about a state. So, it's not the case that we can substitute the linguistic, verbal, or systematic explicit proceduralization of things with imagination; neither will we allow it. You can do ghost-on-fire with systematic, explicit linguistics, and then there's this place for imagination that isn't in that system. But one or the other doesn't exist. Neither extreme works. Right. If you have to choose, if you're only limited, you'd probably choose the more mundane prosaic because it may be mediocre, but at least it's somewhere, whereas if you dream, you're just a dreamer. But I would love for that to be something we could talk about in more academic terms. Many design schools can teach people who can tap into the non-linguistic part of their brain to a useful outcome. Well, I guess my complaint with design schools, having spent a better part of my life in those places, is that they place a premium on the non-explicit, non-systematic, and the students emerge thinking all they have to do is... You know, smoke a joint, walk in the park, sit down, and create. I think you said once, "Just rub your belly and have an idea." That's a good one. That's where ideas come from, and the original article talked about the lone genius thing as inherent to the creation of the beautiful, and I think that is very much a statement of its time. - Yeah, I don't think that's true anymore. - I think there's still a mythology and an aura around that lone genius thing. - That would be worth getting rid of that aura. - Yeah. But the good part is the desire to believe in yourself as someone who could produce that and do the work to get it. The confidence. Yeah, and where does that come from? I don't think, well, it's a guy that was, it was probably 15, 20 years ago, he talked about networks. Our Italian guy, Barbasi. Is this the like? One hundred friends is the most you can have deep connections with. No, it popularized the idea that networks are more powerful than individuals. Ah. Or something like that. Like a way to be tied and strong ties to that thing, or just networks in general? I'm going to get it. I'm also thinking about a good enough-ness in design in the world. This guy, Barabasi. Albert, Albert Laszlo Barabasi. That's not familiar. It would be best if you like pop science. Prominent figure in network science, a discipline that explores complex connections within and among various types of networks. There's more down that down that hole. It's you're not. You're not the sole genius, you know. I think students students need to understand that early on as well. They hate working in groups. You know, it's much easier to work by yourself. It just made me think of this like the idea of connecting; it's as if we could look at the interface of chat GPT as the ultimate summation of the past 25 years of networks. Now see, I like that. The creation and human development of the internet. It's like you're talking to your culture as an individual. Yeah, or at least the part of it that got indexed. Yeah, and the parts that were most referenced to filter to the top of the 25 years of the internet now have this interface. So that's beautiful. that's beautiful. So the pitch is, you know, students should know that they can't work by themselves. The solitary genius is an aura that probably should go away. It probably never really existed, either. So Michael suggests that talking to chat GPT is kind of like talking to a multitude already. because you're talking to all the connections the network of the past 25 years, yeah consensus of the last 20 that's beautiful, I think, but that leads me to think so I'm looking at you because Minsky and the society of mind representative from well you're the only one here that I didn't know him I mean uh uh. Still, there is a notion that an individual is a collective already, a society of mind. It's like multiple personalities. We've got all these little voices in our heads, militating for different things, so Marvin's society of mind theory is that the mind isn't a single thing. It's many little processes pushing you in different directions or making you think different things, and I wonder, did he ever talk about Walt Whitman? Would he have read that? Was he that kind of a person? I couldn't predict that we could ask Margaret. Like large, I contain multitudes. It's one of those beautiful things that Whitman wrote, I think. Do I contradict myself very well, then? I contradict myself. So I think that's a beautiful position to take, I agree. Did he have any interest in the humanities at all? I never heard it. Yeah. But, you know. What was his folk area? Marvin Minsky is one of the... early founders of artificial intelligence. So there was a conference in Dartmouth in 1959, which was widely considered the beginning of artificial intelligence, although work on machines who think that was well before that. But this is the collection of computer scientists, engineers, and electrical engineers positing. Okay, what happened? I can. What is this new emerging field? Marvin was one of them, and then he started the MIT artificial intelligence laboratory, the Mac project, which was man and computer. He was the driving force in artificial intelligence for many years, and his daughter Margaret is on our board. I was curious about the photo/video AI stuff. Is that all rooted in machines looking at images and saying the word "eye" when they see an eyeball or the word "red" when it's red? I don't know. Is it wording all of the images? I think the video stuff is a diffusion model, too. Do you know? I don't know. So, the image, the image stuff, and image making are not symbolic. It's not words. It's based on recognizers, though. So, it's based on AIs that convert images to text. So you have a photograph of an elephant. Yeah. You have an AI that looks at it that's good at recognizing elephants, and it'll say, yep, there's an elephant in there. It says the word elephant. But the crazy thing is that the stable diffusion and those kinds of things start from a field of static, total stochastic noise, and they say, what's in there? You know, you have a prompt; you write a prompt which is an elephant, let's say, and it will look at one field of noise and another field of noise and say, "Well, that one looks more like an elephant." And then it'll take that and make some variations on that and say, "That one looks most like an elephant." So, it slowly gets closer and closer, and eventually, you end up with a picture of an elephant. It's... Because you have a reference to an elephant... You have a recognizer that has been trained on images of elephants. Through all those captchas we clicked on over the decades, where we told them what elephants are. In a way. I mean, you know, Google Image, yeah, I mean, yeah. But you know, some other sources, too, and to be able to say it's an elephant that looks like it was drawn by, you know, Van Gogh. It means you've got overlapping layers of recognizers running. But that is like pure frickin' magic, as far as I can tell. I mean, it's plucking an image out of static. I think it's beautiful, honestly. But then you can't have it make a picture of something you've been trained to recognize. Right? Well, you could say it is an elephant with two trunks. Yeah. Yeah. So it could make things that like. So it could recognize an elephant. Yeah, and it could recognize two things. Yeah, and it could recognize the trunk of the elephant. Yeah. But it couldn't make like species that live on Pluto. hypothetical species that could live on Pluto. Well, I'll take a swing at it. One of the first things I asked Chet GPT to do was tell me the last digit in pi, and it was like, "Oh, it's nine!" It told you.
