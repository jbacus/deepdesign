## Summary
In this discussion, a wide range of topics related to the intersection of technology, employment, and education are explored. The speaker reflects on the diminishing opportunities in fields like marketing, brand management, and graphic design due to technological advancements, notably AI. The conversation delves into the personal impacts of these changes, such as friends losing jobs and struggles to secure internships, contrasting these experiences with reports of new job creation.
The discussion highlights a significant shift towards interest in AI technologies within companies, reducing the need for traditional roles and potentially allowing one person to do the work of two. This technological shift raises concerns about the future of employment and the types of skills that will be valued. The speaker argues that the focus should not just be on how we can use AI to replace jobs but what we should be creating with AI, emphasizing design and intentionality over mere technical skills.
In the educational context, the speaker suggests that teaching should move away from traditional skills and focus more on creative and critical thinking, using AI as a tool to enhance these capacities. There is a call to prepare students not just to use technology, but to question and innovate beyond the status quo, suggesting a blend of liberal arts and technical education might be most beneficial in understanding and directing AI's future applications.
The conversation also touches on the personal anecdotes of using AI in creative projects, the superficiality often produced by AI outputs, and the challenge of encouraging deeper, more meaningful work that surpasses "good enough." This exploration of AI's impact spans practical, philosophical, and ethical dimensions, questioning not only how AI is reshaping professional landscapes but also how it could and should be wielded in the future.
## Topics
1. **Impact of AI on Employment**: The text discusses how advancements in AI and automation are influencing job markets, particularly in creative industries like marketing, design, and branding. There is a significant emphasis on personal experiences related to job losses and reduced job availability due to AI integration.
2. **Educational Response to Technological Change**: The conversation explores how education systems and curricula should adapt to the growing dominance of AI. This includes rethinking the skills that are taught, focusing less on traditional competencies that can be automated and more on creative and critical thinking skills that leverage AI technologies.
3. **Role of Design in AI Era**: It highlights the importance of design thinking in the context of AI. Rather than just creating efficient solutions, there's a need for intentional and thoughtful design decisions about what should be made with AI, advocating for a design-driven approach to technology.
4. **Discrepancy Between Job Creation Reports and Personal Experiences**: While there are reports of job creation, personal anecdotes in the discussion reflect a stark contrast with experiences of job scarcity and layoffs, suggesting a disconnect between statistical reports and ground realities.
5. **Utility and Limitations of AI in Creative Processes**: The text discusses using AI in creative tasks like writing and design, critiquing the superficial and often inadequate outputs of AI when not guided by thoughtful human intervention.
6. **Preparation for Future Careers**: The importance of preparing students not just with technical skills but with the ability to think critically about what and how they create, ensuring they can influence and adapt to future technological landscapes meaningfully.
7. **Philosophical and Ethical Considerations of AI**: There's a philosophical layer to the discussion, questioning the role and impact of AI in our lives and how we might navigate the ethical terrain that comes with such transformative technologies.
8. **Interdisciplinary Education**: The dialogue suggests blending liberal arts with technical education to prepare a workforce capable of more thoughtfully integrating AI into society, capable of engaging with both the technical aspects of AI and the broader social, cultural, and ethical issues.
These topics together paint a complex picture of the current challenges and opportunities presented by AI across various sectors, particularly focusing on employment, education, and the necessity for innovative design thinking.
## Session 1
I think that uncertainty or undefinedness, I see more broadly in on the industry side of like, it does feel, and I mentioned this earlier, I have a bunch of friends in marketing, brand, all that stuff, freelance, not freelance, they are, the work has dried up, there are like no jobs, they're losing their jobs, there's this strange like, what is happening, what is anything, things are either, and it's, you know, people, it's designers, it's motion graphics, marketing like strategists, etc. kind of across the board going like. Did you share your story with Mark about the the job? The job? Yeah, yeah, that like writing gig that I lost to AI and they told me about. they told me about. - Yeah. No one else has had a story where they were directly told they lost the thing to AI, but it does feel like, also looking at, so Lily is looking for an internship, Kaya is talking about finding internships, Brody is looking for a job. All of them are. struggling, and I had, there's this, it's called the Denver Egotist. It's like a brand and marketing and design thing online that has a job board that in the past I've looked at would have dozens of jobs. It has one job, on its job, and so it's weird when we're seeing all these stories of layoffs, but then we're also seeing like today, 300,000 jobs were created last month, or there were 300,000. My experience has certainly been one of layoffs. I mean, and I would say inside of. Inside of my organization, there's a ton of interest in large language models and there's a ton of interest in generative AIs and specifically focused on copilots for programmers and chatbots for websites. Yeah. You know, can we feed it our documentation and then have conversation with the documentation? means you don't have to hire support staffs, and you don't have to hire necessarily two coders. Maybe you could have one do the job of two. I don't think we've quite gotten to that point yet, but every engineer that I talk to wants to talk about that. Yeah. So there's this, it does feel like, in a larger sense, there's this state of flux where either you're uh working for an AI company and it's like hooray or you're like do I have a job still and what's going on even though profits etc seem to be strong overall at like yeah it's like the company's a little bit self I think this begs a question in the context of this program, what do we do to prepare students to be influential? And it seems like it's less, to me, it's less about skills, you know, because the skills are much more ephemeral. It's, I think, more about, it's not the question of how will we make this thing, it's a question of what thing should we make, and to me, that's a design question. Yeah. You know, how we should make it by hand, beautifully, intentionally, that feels like craft. How should we make it With computers and robots in an automated way with high efficiency and great yields that feels like a traditional engineering answer but But still the question is What should we make what intervention we want to bring the world to me? That's fundamentally still a design act. So You know like in my in my class on Thursday I kicked off the final project for the semester and I said use every generative AI tool you can find. Know that everybody in the class has the same advantage that you have. Know that I'm not testing you on your drawing ability, your writing ability, your ability to write a song or put a video together. I'm testing you on what ideas did you come up with? And so your final pitch deck ought to be pretty cool, you know, and I care what your project is, which none of these AIs are going to tell you. You know, you have to come up with the intention of what is the thing that I'm going to propose for the world. Well, there's also what I'm hearing from that in part is this thing that I'm... like on the research side no one is saying well AI is here so we don't need research. Research is still valuable and still has a point and if anything is more valuable now or more of interest whereas on the academic side it's like the academic side is the question mark. ways of like do I need a degree or what should my degree be in what I what should I even study is it yeah is there a point and then on the job side kind of the same thing what skills do I need what kind of job do I qualify for now do I will I still have a job in six months that kind of stuff so it almost it makes me think about like well we've got this research side that actually is singularly focused on discovery and the pursuit of knowledge and newness, new stuff and what we might learn from that and apply to this. like idea around design or even the value of the academic side and the fact that we have both here perhaps even more strongly or even more valuable. I saw okay so I'm not seeing a lot from grouping. Wolfram gave a TED talk last year did you? It's about the physics project, but at the end of it, he made this very provocative statement that kind of sounded like the people we need in the future, the people we need the most in the future are liberal arts people, and he's pretty science-y. You know, if ever there was a STEM org, he was an advanced rank in the STEM org, and, you know, I've seen similar arguments made about specifically large language models. Who do you want analyzing what operations on language are? on language and art. Do you want an engineer that's never read Pride and Prejudice? Or do you want somebody that, you know, understands how language works? Maybe even somebody that's, you know, read a little Therian. Yeah, you know, like has a passion for it too, and understands, you know, the subtleties in tone and voice and, you know, these are things which are natural. operational parts of the large language model, and the engineers look at it and say, "Oh, it works." But, you know, maybe a poet looks at it really differently. But so it's just a funny observation. I've seen it from a couple AI kind of folks, because it's at a time when engineering programs seem like they're getting more and more important. maybe the business school is more and more important, and arts and sciences, I mean, it's like a literature major is the butt of every joke, you know? - I'm trying to remember, to go to my memory about poetry. - Google's CFO at the time I was there. used to, you know, there was this tradition of a Friday all-hands meeting. You can ask whoever shows up any question you want. The CFO used to answer in haiku. It was kind of like in shtick for a while. - Yeah. - Which is kind of showing off Mappy sort of music language, but at the same time. - I'm trying to find this conversation. to BT about poetry and the way it talked about, I asked it to write a poem. I don't know why it's not, all my chats for like the past year are in here except this one. - Well, I-- - Oh. I found it. - You found it. - So, okay, so I asked it to write a poem, but not use the, but to use the 20th iteration of what it would have. So kind of like it push it's thinking forward To write 20 poems and tell me the last one basically, okay And it wrote rhyming couplets. Mm-hmm, and I was like I Asked it why it rhymed okay rhyming felt I wasn't expecting it to rhyme. How did you decide to do that? That was me asking Rhyming felt like a natural way to enhance the whimsical and playful tone of the poem. Since the word associations themselves were already quite surreal and unexpected, adding a rhyming structure helped to create a sense of cohesion and rhythm throughout the piece. Rhymes can also make a poem more memorable and enjoyable to read aloud. That is the most asinine way to think about poetry. and it's so funny that it gives you this like jaunty, oh, poetry is blah, blah, blah. Like it's as if it's being read in the TikTok voice, the TikTok like AI lady's voice, just like, this is what poetry is. enjoyable to when it rhymes, and it's only ever really going to be that, and if not more so. It's that like neutral, surfacy kind of thing, and yes, you can, I'm sure, find ways to get it to be deeper, that kind of thing. But this is its understanding of poetry. So I have a supporting example for you, and I posted it up on the, it's kind of like, what was the project I did over spring break? I worked with Chad GPT on two writing projects. The first one was, I said, essentially, write me a textbook. for a course on design foundations in using the principles of deep design in the age of generative AI, and the other one was start from the essay "Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." I want you to preserve the style and structure. original essay but replace mechanical reproduction with generative AI. Okay so these were the two projects. I actually had a great conversation with David Hunter about, I'll come back to that one, so the the textbook actually did a pretty good job of it, right? You know it wrote a pretty decent abstract and then I said okay well give me you know give me an hour. outline, you know, make the book this many chapters, 15 week course of 15 sections, did okay with that, you know, and then I said, well, probably one chapter at a time, give me the abstract for each one of these chapters, and you know, it did a pretty good job of that, and you know, it came out sounding like any business textbook ever. mm-hmm which I would not be proud of but it would be a competent answer to the question mm-hmm work of art in the age of generative AI it was exactly like you described with the poetry example yet it made some obvious mistakes like the first you know I was going like section at a time. I think the Walter Benjamin's essay has, I don't remember, 14, 12, 12, 13 sections, something like that, and I asked for more sections and it just kept writing them. But the last section just got duplicated over and over. There's nothing more to say about this. You know, I have no more, I have nothing new to say, and it was terrible. It was... schmaltz. It absolutely debased the original essay, lost all the context, all the interest in it, and I just felt like, well, this is clearly the quality metric for the output of the AI for this kind of problem. It looks good enough. I think that's that's the big thing this this good enough And this is what I sense is happening on the business side is that? We don't care about actually good or Some of those before but like real branding or sophisticated branding it's a pre It's more, it doesn't matter, we can charge more anyway because of the way the economy works now. Yeah, we don't have to do better than that. We don't care. It doesn't have, it actually can be fine. Yeah. Fine is fine, and the idea of the like, the BC student sense and like a lot of what you get back is kind of like, yeah, this is competently written. it's not saying anything. It's actually saying, I mean, to talk about poetry this way, it's like dark. Yeah. But most people will be like, oh, yeah. Great. Catchy. Yeah, and it's, it's the fact that we're fine with that now that is, is challenging to me. I mean I had this experience using Suno. Is it s-u-n-o? s-u-n-o.ai. It's the song song creating AI. So I always play a little music when the students are coming in the beginning of my lecture and so I put a playlist together of six you know rap songs written by Suno that were, if you listen to the lyrics it was you know. "Hey, I'm a student at the University of Colorado coming into a lecture and Design Foundation is going to talk about computation today. I'm excited and a little tired." And so I got six songs that basically had that in it and I was playing them, and then I always ask at the end, as I'm spinning up the lecture part of the lecture, I always say, "Okay, who knows what that song is?" And they were all like, "Oh, yeah, I've heard that song before. There's something familiar about it. Yeah, there's a cowboy back there. Yeah, it was horrible." It's like, "Did you listen to the -- " "Oh, yeah, I didn't listen to the lyrics." Laughter So they basically didn't notice, you know, because I had made, essentially, the musical version of the poem that you're hearing. It was sort of acceptable in every way, exceptional in none, and so it just faded into the background. Can I offer a question? So is this a program where we encourage better than good enough? Bye-bye. ♪ Shining so bright ♪ - Okay, and, you know, I'll take the, yes, we should do better than good enough, but, you know, if so, then how do you define that in an age where good enough, better sort of slightly better, sort of slightly better than a neophyte. I mean, these songs that Suno makes are better than any song I could produce. But I'm not a song producer. I'm not a songwriter. So how do we restate the question? How do we encourage the development of design ideas that are better than good enough? One way might be English craft, you know, joy in the making, joy in the materials, joy in the... Another way might be, what? I mean, what are some other ways? I mean, how does a literature program do it? Because I feel like a writing program, okay? We've talked about writing rooms before. to go bring it to Gabriel's writing workshops, but yeah. - So how does that work? - Well, that, he described a process by which writers present their work to their community and get critique and feedback from people, broadly speaking. piece of music with Chris Alexander. So those are the two themes of Dick Gabriel, but largely it's about he's a software engineer, accomplished software engineer, who got interested in poetry, got into MFA in poetry, and now thinks in both of these realms. So I think he's saying, hey, there's something that the tech community can learn. from the writers, which is the style of presenting work and getting feedback about your work, which is different than the academic research community, which has its own peer-review method, which, for a bit, it has different outcomes. He was arguing for the writer's workshop method. So that-- I think it was powerful. I don't know. I'm eager to try it. I thought about bringing him here and doing this thing, except that... Well, to what extent does the answer to this question depend on the perceived value in a professional workplace? So when a student leaves this program... I want to go get a job, the climate right now is maybe harder than it's been in past years. Is the reason that good enough is good enough, does that come from the fact that with a kind of an MBA's mindset, you know, you're optimizing as little effort as possible. for a maximum financial return. - I think it's a valid analysis. My impression of this university for the last five years that I've been acquainted with it is that, no, it's the culture of the place. We're a second tier public university. We don't aspire to getting the best job. We just, in engineering, we want to get the best job. want to go be a middle manager at the ball by the time we're done, right? That's where that's where they're at and there's exceptional students who come through all the time and I've been fortunate to have some of them who exceed that and they're looking for teachers who will challenge them to do more. They are there and but it is sort of a deadening culture when three of your class wants to do good enough, then you're pulled towards, "Okay, that's what they want. We'll give them that." Well, okay, I'm going to arrogantly assume that the three of us are not satisfied with good enough, and we aspire to better. Why? What happened to you? What happened to me? What happened to you? Well, one, because we can't, it's like already. Yeah, and two, we've seen stuff that maybe always happens. Mm-hmm. OK, I think I also have a sort of outsider-y, like, it's easy to call it cynicism, but like a questioning, or why? Whenever I see like the average happening, I'm like, I don't want to, I'm not interested in that or I'm probably looking for novelty. Novelty, a little bit of a competitive feeling. Okay. But weirdly, it's on my terms in a way. It's like, I don't care about sports, for example. a competitive medium, but I'm competing almost on like ideas like what's more interesting or more exciting, and then I also, and I've noticed this with a lot of students here at Atlas particularly, care about learning stuff and a variety of things and I'm not in some ways I've admired people who are like I'm gonna be a doctor I've known this since I was like 12 and I'm a doctor and that's what I do. Very successful strategy. Yeah. Not my strategy. Never yeah I could. He was 14 years old he knew he was gonna be an AI guy he was gonna be a Marvin Minsky student. But now Marvin's gone. That's what you want. David's graduated. It's onto itself. So I've been interested in learning stuff. I've always been like, "Oh, that's cool, that's cool." Yeah. Okay, so that's... I saw an interview this morning, old interview, doesn't matter how I ended up down that rabbit hole with Daniel Day-Lewis. Okay, great actor, phenomenal actor, and he made a statement that, you know, the question was, where have you been? What have you been doing? You know, it was, it was an interview about gangs of New York. He'd been retired for five years prior to that, and so the question is basically, why didn't you act? more and and he was sort of struggling with the question and kind of came out with a statement that um the the kick for him in his particular way of acting was discovering the character once that was done and he was on set he was performing that's just doing the work you know and that part was a lot less fun than uncovering the inner workings of you know this character and and so that he was I think driving directly at the point that curiosity and the satisfaction of that curiosity is the best thing for him anyway that's like his source of happiness it was the discovery of those things. Where does that mindset come from? I mean, how do you know? How did you become curious? Okay, partly it's a I think it's a cultivated thing, but there's also just those kids. There's always the kid who's like looking at the bugs. Yeah, or something, you know, like, right, and I, I think weirdly to me, I was always like, look at that kid looking at the bugs. That's interesting. I wasn't the bug kid, but I was like interested in the kid looking at the bugs, you know, or like that's sort of observational thing, but there are other people who just have real passions and Obsess over them, you know and in some ways now you can it's a lot more accessible to dig into stuff learn about you know get get like some level deep on just YouTube alone I mean I would say amazingly so yeah and it's you know YouTube and Wikipedia and let's say the World Wide Web it's the world's greatest reference library but also amazon.com I can get you know both I want most of them can be here this afternoon. So access to material, access to methods of-- I talk to students about how powerful they are as designers because they have access to-- maybe 3D printers are not the greatest way to prototype something. But man, you can make any form you want, pretty much. You know, an arduino, you can make a microcontroller for anything you want. It does feel like a skill that we need to have now that we didn't need 30 years ago is the ability to truly narrow your focus or actually focus on a thing in that you could swim around in a world of "I could do this, I could..." I could even if you have the question in mind that you want to solve infinite ways to solve it so you have to go like all right let me explore this actual area to solve this with some level of depth rather than swimming in a sea of options, let alone if you don't even have an idea of what you're interested in or want to pursue. You could just be floundering around. You could flounder forever. Or you could, you know, I practiced guitar today and then I tried coding and then I tried Spanish and then, you know, you can, at a surface level... dig into things that you might be interested in forever and that's almost your that almost becomes your hobby is just trying out hobbies so it's like how do you find the balance between like having enough hobbies that you can turn something in a way. Like so for me as a musician, so like I was an English major, so I learned about writing and poetry and blah blah blah in college while I was personally doing like learning guitar and stuff like that, but then I also learned like recording on a computer in the 2000s. So those are different skills all coming together that now I can write and produce and record and release music myself entirely, and that was a specific set of things that I learned how to do that all kind of came together. So I wonder if there's something around that like, well, this is my sort of trot out my hobby horses over and over again, but one of them is the interesting people are the ones who can bring different disciplines together and be an expert in more than one thing, and that's what you just described versus I'm going to be the best trombonist on the planet. That's a cool thing, too, but if you're going to be the best trombonist on the planet, you can be a very good trombonist and a very good recording engineer. So that's what you chose, and to me, those are the interesting places and people, and Atlas isn't where you would go to become the best trombonist on Earth, or the best computer program on Earth, necessarily. It's where you get a trombonist, it's a pretty good program. That's where your story weakens because, oh, you can be a shitty trombonist and be an atlas, right? I mean, it's like, where's the bar, right? You're not going to be the best trombonist on the planet if you're here, but that doesn't mean that you'll be a kindergarten trombonist. You'll still be a competent, capable, and maybe... maybe even creative trombonist, just not the best. - Because you also have these other skills that the best trombonist doesn't have, necessarily. - I mean, this is the theory that there's an equal amount of attention. If you put 10,000 hours speaking to an expert here, you're not gonna go completely by that theory, and I don't think everyone's made the way you're made and the way Eric Schweigart is made and the way I'm made. but we attract those people, I think. - There was something, we might've talked about this before, but in my last job, we specifically, for a long time, hired based on resume, but also for like, oh, this person also loves photography, or they're a musician on the side. There was something else that was not directly related to their job. but they were passionate about and often they like blogged about it or something like that. So they were not only displaying passion about a thing that was not career-related necessarily, but then also specifically expressing that passion. line. So that actually directly translated to their job of marketing other people's stuff. But that sense that we would look around and go like, oh yeah, he's really into photography, or that person paints, or that person is an incredible baker, or these other skills that weren't directly related to the work and specifically. looking for that in a candidate. I think that's when we attract, I hope. But you want the polymath, not the jack-of-all-trades. Not the dimmerton. Not the dimmerton. Right. What's interesting-- I'm curious if that-- where do, like, SAT scores fit into that mentality? I guess it's for predictors. Is it possible that the person who's good at computer programming and baking maybe is not a great test taker necessarily? I mean we call them extracurriculars, right? I think most of the time it would be, you know, you've got really high SAT scores, you've got a very high GPA, you've got plenty of AP credits, and you're in the band, you know? Those are the type of achievers who just want to get into Harvard and figure out what to do to get into Harvard. It's not necessarily... I want it to be real, but... Well, I'm curious about that. Because, like, how much of Harvard is comprised of those people? And if it's a high percentage, is that any different than CU being good and... having the good enough mentality almost like that's kind of your tier two versus tier one. Yeah, and maybe I'm That's assuming that the Harvards of the world are full of people who are really good at being students And whether that's actually Good or not like it makes Is Harvard better from a SAT score standpoint? And yes, they do end up, for whatever reason, getting better jobs. Oh, wow. But... Harvard, everybody who applies to Harvard has 800 SAT scores, so it's sort of, it's not a great sort because they can still pick really interesting people among the people who suck high. Okay, fair enough. I had a colleague in mechanical engineering, I think it was ASU, and he was deeply interested in design, which is why I know him, and he said the best predictor of design success in students was, grad students, was high verbal GRA. Really? Yeah. They had done some correlations. I don't know how real that result is. Do you think you could apply that to, like, an understanding more broadly, it's you get language and how language works? Or is it more like you've probably read Pride and Prejudice? I don't know. Or I'm stuck on Pride and Prejudice. Probably not. I mean, I will say one of the skills that I am learning here is that it, being in the role of like art director or creative director when I'm working with like Lily for example is having to explain what is good or bad right or wrong or just needs improvement when it comes to a designed thing, and a lot of times it's like it's feel based. Nudge it, press down, like move it down two pixels, and sometimes it's like this float, something is weird here and we need to figure out a way. So like being able to communicate the around design is actually really challenging. - Thank you. there's "Lily, do this, try this," but there's also explaining the rationale, which you don't necessarily have to do in order to get her to do the thing. But if you really want her to become a better designer, then she either has to just learn it by repetition and make it her own without actually having the rationale explicit, or learn to be explicit about the rationale for why, what's principle here that causes you to say this should go down and that to me is what in traditional design programs seldom happens because the people who teach the design don't really think rationally about why they're doing what they're doing, but they know they're exquisite at doing it and so they do it and learn by example. So that's sort of like, you know, you're apprenticing to a master, and the master might not be able to explain why. I mean, I think in my education, I learned to particularly treasure those masters who could explain, and, you know, like I've talked about Brian Eno a lot. There are plenty of musicians that are better than Brian Eno, but there are a few musicians who are Better than Brian Eno at sitting down and explaining why what he does works, you know And the fact that he's also a producer so he helped you to become a certain kind of you too Which is for sure skill like? that that ability to work with others because the thing that design is not Like no one is just designing for themselves for like in a bubble. You're always designing in coordination with other people. Often people who don't know how to communicate about design and don't have that skill. Other than I always come back to like, I don't like pink. Why is this pink? And so you have to have conversations about design. to have communication. You have to be able to go, well what is it about, is this you just not liking paint? Or like what is fundamentally, how do we get this to be good? It's a communication process, the design process. There was a bar in East Village that was a place where all the abstract expressionist painters got together and talked about their work. I don't remember if it was five something or something like that, and abstract expressionism, I think, is particularly difficult to talk about what makes something good and not good, and I just remember, I think it was actually Dori Ashton that would tell this story because she would hang out at that bar. She talked about the difference between Robert Motherwell and Jackson Pollock, and she said, I mean, I'm not putting words in her mouth exactly. She would have been a lot more poetic about this. But, you know, Jackson Pollock was Trump and didn't know why he did what he did, but it worked, and Motherwell could give you, you know. acres of text on the subject of why this thing worked and he would try how many elegies to the Spanish Republic are there I mean he just did it over and over and over again and really refined it and he could say well this one's better than that one because of that you know so for students which one is better for an art collector who cares yeah right but for students the one that can sit and explain it, at least for students like us. I want to go back to-- you kind of glossed over something a minute ago. Can I delve on it? So I think we were talking about curiosity or something like that, and I said, how did that develop for you? And you said, well, I was just raised that way. What did they do? why they were both scientists and so every conversation had that undertone I guess. Was it an undertone of? Were they like question or like kind of curiosity built in or answer questions or? I haven't thought about it that way so I don't know I can't think about it but it's pretty clear to me that my who I am. am is largely the result of the early upbringing and the way that we interacted with the grown-ups and other kids at the time. So for sure, but I want to dig into this. So I think I grew up with a similar kind of curiosity in the household and and And I've thought about what contributed to that because then I wanted to do it with my kids, and one of the things that I remember my parents doing, particularly my mother, was if I went to the toy store, I had a budget. If I went to the art supply store, there was no budget. If I... There was always a room... the house that was just given over to the disaster of failed creative project. Right? And, you know, if I ever wanted, if I ever wanted a piece of lumber, you know, I wanted a new screwdriver. I wanted a soldering iron because I want to learn how to solder. There was never any budget for that. It was always 100% funded. no question about it. It was even like, "Shit, drop everything. We're going right now. What do you need? You want two of them? What do you need? Let's get a good one because then you'll really learn." And I think that led to the bad—I'm actually not sure it's bad—but it led to a dilettante mindset. could it be? You know, but I think it also led to a feeling of freedom to explore anything creative. Yeah. I think that's different than you're describing. Because my parents were not creatives and art was not understood. I was dragged through all art museums of Europe as a... under seven. So I was exposed to a lot of Renaissance art and early art. But they didn't particularly understand art. It wasn't that they opposed it, but they were happy to have me do whatever. No, I think it was all conversation. My mother was a lab chemist. My dad was a So it was more about how, why is the sky blue? - And if you asked a question of your dad, like why is the sky blue? How would that go? What would that, what would the response be like? - Well, we start with Maxwell and Clark and. - Okay, when you're eight, you know. Yeah. So he went super deep, super fast. Well, and math is at the bottom of everything from there. It's just, it's really mathematics. - Well, it sounds like they respected your intellect in a way, to not dumb it down or not. - Oh yeah. Well, and the way, this is what I learned from them, is that exactly, you respect people and you treat them like adults and then they become adults and they become adults. But I wanted to go somewhere different too. So now that startups are no longer, the luster is off the startup route. But distinguishing, so the standard story in startup is go study your customer, find the pain point, find the aspirin, and pivot, pivot, pivot. Obviously, you try to intrusive blank way of starting companies, and maybe they're successful. But there's another kind which is the passion driven founder, and that's not part of the culture, but that actually creates the truly groundbreaking innovative. But those people have to ignore all the advice to pivot. a pivot because they should be following their passions. Drive, drive, drive. Focus, focus, focus. That CEO almost always gets kicked out eventually. Yeah, well then that's fine. VC hires somebody else, but yeah, but they built the thing originally, yeah. But I think one of the best predictors of the failure of a product-based startup is winning an industrial design award. When we, at my last agency, we had this realization that if a client or any company we were sort of around, we saw that they, that the CFO became the CEO, we knew that they were doomed or that it was just not going to work, and often the COO was like, eh. but you would just see like oh and it's all just finance based there's no idea there's nothing yeah and they'll actually actively kill okay so what can I propose yeah so if we have this if we have this so the primacy of the building of the business school on campus. I maybe make claims that the business school and the engineering school are the two sources of power on campus. Okay, controversial. The promise I think not just of startups but of business schools in general is that money is the metric for success, and so success you should drive, you should drive... What am I trying to... Specifically that, that we measure success by the amount of revenue that can be created. Are there other metrics for success? And I think that drives a certain class of behavior, right? I mean it definitely drives the good enough solution is good enough. I think it also drives kind of... of street lighting problem-solving where we're going to solve the problem that we know how to solve because that will give us a predictable outcome. We can predictably make revenue. I think the passion project of the genius founder is much more unpredictable. Much higher risk and higher reward but we tend towards... appreciating the risk more than the reward. I think a lot of times too it's because those founders don't come from a business background, whereas the other funder almost always comes from a business background. Great, great. So I was thinking about New Venture Challenge. Yeah, and the last time I judged the New Venture Challenge, the companies that came through and made it through my round of judging, I was like... These are derivative. I'm uninterested in this. I believe you may make some money. I don't believe you're going to make a ton of money. You know, it's just really not that inspiring. So the question is, well, I'm taking the assumption that using money as the metric for the value of an idea. 10 to select against outside ideas. So that means you need a different motivator to get somebody to do that, that breakout idea. Where, what are those different motivators and are those things that this, this school, if we're talking about school or this methodology. design could appreciate. So social good is a great motivator, but it's very abstract, and companies that are built around social good don't seem to break out. When that is the... Yeah. With some like, oh, this is Paul Hawken. Oh. Was that the right name? He sells for a million dollars. Yeah, I always knew that from the Horace Kellogg. Really? Okay. He was part of the Portola Group. Okay. But I think that worked because he kind of said, "Hey, social good can make money." Right. So money was the metric, right? Well, because money is a uniform metric, right? >> And it has the same value for everybody. >> That's why it's translated to money. Well, I don't have an answer to that, but I think it's true that the people, students in this program are not driven by the business success. They have an idea, we are the pre new venture challenge, right? It's not like we're gonna do. market analysis and figure out what the market will support. It's like I've got this cool way to make clothing out of kombucha and I want to make a business out of it, which isn't the fashion driven. But so we we we select for students who come with that patch. Yeah, and we give them a place to develop it. Where do they get it? I think, I don't know where they, but we don't really, it's not really an entrepreneurial It's kind of missing the last two steps of the entrepreneurship piece, being like fundraising, and arguably we could. We could. It's been a topic of discussion. It's been a topic of discussion and something we could relatively easily do. The counter to that is everybody else, once you've got your idea to the level of it... then there's plenty of support for them on campus, so we shouldn't be duplicating and removing them. But, maybe we should, because when they go and do it with Catalyze, they get told to pivot, pivot, pivot. Well, I would argue, Leeds is good at, if there are four steps being, it's more than this, but like, come up with an idea and like prototype it, then... get the funding for it and market it, roughly, maybe those are the four. Leeds does three and four really well. We do one and two really well, so why aren't we? Because they also think they do one and two. Or they do things that do one and two. But what they do for one in particular is follow a pretty dogmatic design thinking. approach right which is makes sense because it's sort of a process that has steps so you can go through you can go through that step and maybe you'll get an outcome and it's a little more geared toward like not i think here you can actually make a three-dimensional object as your thing and that's not really what well how is over there. It's more like make the uber of blank. There's no money in product so it's all software infrastructures that can make money. Yeah. I think that's, I, we should go deeper on that question. So the, because the critique of design thinking, at least when it came out in that Harvard Business Review, you article, you know, predicting the death of design thinking. The critique there was design thinking has become a theatrical, it's, you know, kabuki theater that doesn't really create anything at the end. Theater is entertaining and wonderful to watch, but it doesn't actually produce a result, and so, you know, and why not? probably because that isn't its intent. - The longevity piece was the big missing factor there, it seemed like, like they would create, oh, we built this, what was their example? It was like teaching women's health through like nail salons as the representative gathering for women in developing countries, and they did it once and it worked, but then they just like, that was it? There was no, like, the longevity piece was missing. It was in part because it was project-based and not like larger than that or there's a fun whatever and it's those missing It's the hardest part. You can come up with cool ideas and prototype them all day. The hardest part is actually making it a sustained-- - Execution. - Solution. 'Cause it's not a solution until you're actually solving some stuff. - Right. - And you're doing so in a long-term way. It's just an idea, or it's just a like... It's like Tesla is not really a car company, really Tesla is a company that makes factories that produce cars. One of their by-products is a car. You could argue they're not really doing that anymore either. Yeah, it's, the challenge perhaps is like on a larger sense, we don't design thinking certainly doesn't doesn't solve for this. I hate that phrase, but like, it doesn't address the long term thing, nor does anything else, really, aside from kind of the like, these venture capital model of like, okay, we're making this a real business and in order for it to continue to exist it needs to gather grow users or make money or whatever those sort of like measurable indicators and then it is allowed to continue to exist and grow and be a quote-unquote solution and that's not ideal for if you want to improve women's health in rural Africa, for example, like that model is such a blunt force tool, like, we don't have a good substitute for, unless we're talking about like, you know, I don't know, UN investment, maybe or something like that, where they are willing to invest for 10 years in a thing. I don't know. that they do very that those that strategy works particularly well for them either totally so so i'm pretty sure you're onto something there i don't know how to snapshot it yeah well name it so what can you give it a name so it's something about like the worst solution is thrown around so much, but a real solution is long-term, and if it is such a solution, it should almost be inevitable in a way. It should work. It should disseminate through culture, and what design thinking pretends to do is create solutions, but there is no actual solving, because there's a missing piece at the end of the hard part of... I mean, we're being... I don't know. We're trashy design thinking, and I'm happy to join that party. Well, I think there are probably some design opportunities that yield well to design thinking. That you can run a design thinking process and produce a better instrument for cars. So, it's not that it's useless and good for nothing. It's not that it's not really wrong. Like the nail salon thing could have been. that was a great idea, but there's that why wasn't it implemented? Well, the paper was that it wasn't the right idea. Well, that it was never tested with the group of people that would really implement it, and so, you know, it was kind of... I mean, I got a little hint of cultural imperialism in that yeah, you know, we came in with a great idea and Look at the cool thing we made it but then Well, but a lot of their I always go back to the shopping cart thing Like if the shopping cart they made this cool redesign of the shopping cart that looked Okay This is cool, why didn't it get adopted more widely? And how do, what is the thing there? Like how do we... Well, okay, so there's a story. You know, we get on airplanes, right? We go to the airport, we wait in lines, they call the boarding call, you line up in your rows, you get on the plane, right? This is really inefficient, and... A long time ago, some father, uncle, one of my students had this other idea that you could simply load everybody up to into a pod and then in once in the waiting room and then drop the pod into the plane. Why didn't that happen? It's a better idea. Well, because all the infrastructure was already in place for the old way of doing things and you can't make that change. So you're in, you're on a hill. It's a hill climbing thing, and you can't go from there to there, even if it's a better solution. So there's something that I've learned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to come back to the question that you asked when I walked in, which is like, am I just pushing this deep design? Maybe this is something that only I want to do, but that this isn't. or in the culture here? I think partly the answer is yes, but but why not? I mean this is and people will get behind it if you get it to be successful people get behind it if there's funding behind it. So I'm not too worried about bringing the crew along. If we ask them what they want to be, we're gonna get an incoherent answer anyway. Nice to listen. I still think that the design of things and systems and processes is paramount to human success. needs living with and that we don't do it particularly well except in particular niches. So we're probably really good at medical device design, if we're a medical device design house. But we don't teach that skill and we don't have systematic ways of doing design that can be applied in different domains, and so that's a problem that the world isn't falling apart because we haven't addressed that. But that is something that design thinking would purport to do and something that needs to be done better than it's being done. So you have the design department, which is really some combination of graphic design and web design and art, but it's very niche, and then you have particular engineering design. I don't want to go to aviation design, but it's not, there's no overarching scheme or system or method and it's, so we don't teach it particularly well, we do apprentices. There are particular methodologies for particular artifacts or service design, okay, we don't have a service design now. So I feel like that is something that is. meaningful in the world and a gap that we could try to fill or a place that we could try to make a contribution, and then the other piece of this is to say, so what is it so that in the 30s, you had design schools like all in the battle house. IIT, whatever they were they were pretty successful. at the thing in the day that they were and they've had lasting impact too, and they had lasting impact, and I mean we're living some of the... I mean I teach it and when I talk about color. Yeah. So what I come back to, what is that today, right? So what was it then? Well, it was manufacturing, it was industrial, you know, the... not the end, but the... flourishing, the blooming of the industrial age. We knew how to use machines, we had plastic, new colors, new pigments, new colors. So what is the analog of today? And part of it surely is generative AI or large, large. not language models, but the internet access to all the information in the world. Those are the things that are the parallels to whatever they were in the day of the balance. So that's how we should be thinking about what is the design school of today, and I mean, whether they want to call it design or they want to call it art, it's like, not to worry. But I think. that description of it, for sure, and I wonder if what I'm reacting against in design thinking is, you know, where you're sort of painting a picture where technology gives us new tools and affordances and we can do new things with that. What I, what I Bye. kind of recoil against in design thinking is that it's it's an automated process rather than it's not new tools and affordances it's a process that you know it's like their design is a design is a function. That is exactly why it was successful, and that's exactly why it was successful because I think a lot of You know since the Industrial Revolution way before that technology has been cast as a way of automating the drudgery of life what and you know and I sort of recoil against Automating the drudgery of design away because that's the kick for me. That's precisely the part that I agree want to do so age of generative AI, are we automating the design and therefore automating the kick-out for that? Maybe it's a subset of the population or are we... So I pitch generative AI tools as new tools and affordances. Now you as a designer, your vision, your... your hope for the world is, you know, you're more powerful. We are, it was in the whole earth catalog, we are, we are as gods, so we may as well get good at it, right? Which is, I think, a very different attitude. Then let's automate the drudgery of life, and we can spend more time, you know, on the golf course. or whatever. Well, I don't have much to add. I was attracted to computer-aided design, as we fondly know it. Not because I thought it would automate the design process, but I thought there are things that, as a designer, we do. or that designers do, that are in some sense tedious and I can automate my own things. So I can, if I've got routines that I do, I can get this machine to do them for me, and it's not that I'm, not even that I'm delegating. I'm building myself tools to do the things that I want to do. subtle very intentional control very intentional so I can build the language of the design thing that I'm making and then I can exercise that language and I don't have to draw every line anymore because I've built a little tool that it's like so when you're making models in architecture school you can either glue each stick together or you can make jigs that make the parts and you can write so it's it's that same uh power and control that you get. So it's not that AI is going to hand over the whole thing to the AI. It's that you can. Yes you're automating something to be sure. It's not that automation is out. It's that the control of what you automate and how you automate becomes you. So you're you're putting into this machine. partner the things that you want to do and that you do and that you. I think along those lines, through the lens of pure efficiency and the focus on the building of A.I., but also looking at how business works, which is the pursuit of. efficiency for, like you, a lot of the problems being solved, quote-unquote, are through efficiency gains. We take one step out of the process and therefore we make $10 more. Yeah, and also a lot of the like, like I think about this client I used to work with, they, this was a salesman who worked in sales for and there was this annoying part about Salesforce. So he built this software that solved the annoying part about Salesforce and built this huge company by solving this one dumb thing about Salesforce, essentially. It's about efficiency gains. It isn't about going, well, sales is, why are we doing sales or why is sales like this? Why are we, it's just, this is the system we're in, and I'm finding this one piece of efficiency too.
