## Preface

When Marx embarked on his critique of the capitalist mode of production, capitalism was still in its nascent stages. Marx's critique was meticulously crafted to have prognostic significance. He delved into the foundational conditions of capitalist production and, through his analysis, projected what the future of capitalism might hold. His insights led to the prediction that capitalism would not only intensify the exploitation of the proletariat but would also sow the seeds for its own eventual dissolution.

The transformation of the superstructure, which unfolds much more gradually than changes in the substructure, has taken over half a century to permeate all cultural domains, reflecting the shift in production conditions. Only now can we articulate the nature of this transformation. These observations must meet certain prognostic criteria. Yet, speculations on the art of the proletariat post-revolution, or on the art of a classless society, might not fully align with these criteria as much as reflections on the current developmental tendencies of art within existing production conditions. The dialectic at play within the superstructure is as palpable as it is within the economy. Thus, it would be a mistake to undervalue such analysis as a strategic tool. They sweep away numerous outdated notions—creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery—terms whose unchecked (and currently almost uncheckable) application could lead to a manipulation of data in a Fascist manner. The concepts introduced into the theory of art henceforth diverge from more traditional terms, rendering them utterly ineffectual for Fascist ends. Conversely, they hold significant value for articulating revolutionary demands within the politics of art.

In this era, when Marx's critique is revisited, the concept of Mechanical Reproduction is supplanted by that of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). This shift is not merely technological but profoundly impacts the substructure and superstructure alike, mirroring the transformative potential Marx attributed to capitalism.

Generative AI, in its essence, revolutionizes the production and dissemination of art, challenging the very fabric of artistic creation, ownership, and distribution. It democratizes the ability to create, erasing the traditional barriers that reserved artistic production for those deemed geniuses or inherently creative. This technological evolution disrupts the notion of eternal value and mystery in art, as the algorithms capable of generating art ad infinitum question the scarcity that once underpinned art's value.

The introduction of Generative AI into the discourse of art theory is pivotal. Unlike the concepts it replaces, Generative AI is impervious to Fascist co-optation. It inherently promotes a collective approach to art, emphasizing the role of communal algorithms and data pools over individual genius. This shift aligns with the Marxist vision of a classless society, where art is not a commodity to be exploited but a shared cultural heritage, accessible and created by all.

Thus, in the politics of art, Generative AI becomes a beacon for revolutionary potential. It embodies the dialectical overturning of outdated artistic concepts, paving the way for a reimagined cultural superstructure that mirrors the egalitarian, collective, and non-exploitative ideals at the heart of Marxist thought. In this light, Generative AI does not merely represent a technological advancement but heralds a profound cultural and societal transformation, echoing the revolutionary changes Marx envisioned for the capitalist system itself.

## I

In principle, a work of art has always possessed the potential for duplication. Human-made artifacts could always be replicated by human hands. Replicas were crafted by apprentices as part of their training, by masters to disseminate their works, and, ultimately, by third parties driven by profit. The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the creation of art, however, signifies a novel departure. Historically, it has evolved not steadily but in bursts and significant leaps, gaining momentum with each advancement. The ancients were acquainted with only a handful of techniques for the technical reproduction of art: casting and stamping. Bronzes, terra cottas, and coins were the extent of artworks they could mass-produce. All others remained unique and beyond the scope of mechanical duplication. With the advent of the woodcut, graphic art first became mechanically reproducible, long before the written word could be replicated by printing. The profound transformations that printing—the mechanical reproduction of text—brought to literature are well-documented. Yet, within the broader context of world history that we are exploring, printing represents merely a specific, albeit critically important, instance.

With the emergence of Generative AI, the technique of art reproduction entered a fundamentally new phase. This leap forward is characterized not by the manual tracing of designs on stone or the incision on woodblocks or etching on copperplates, but by the algorithmic generation of art, allowing for the production of artworks in vast quantities and in constantly evolving forms for the first time. Generative AI enabled graphic art to mirror the flux of daily life, aligning it more closely with the pace of contemporary existence. However, merely a few decades after its inception, Generative AI's capabilities were already being expanded upon by more sophisticated algorithms. For the first time in the history of pictorial reproduction, these advanced algorithms relieved the artist's hand of its most crucial creative roles, which were now assumed by the computational 'eye' of AI systems. Since these systems can process and generate images far more rapidly than the human hand can draw, the process of pictorial reproduction was accelerated to an unprecedented degree, enabling it to synchronize with the immediacy of human speech. A director using AI to generate scenes for a movie can produce images at the pace of an actor's dialogue. Just as lithography once heralded the illustrated newspaper, so does Generative AI foreshadow the era of dynamically generated visual content. The technical reproduction of sound, tackled at the end of the last century, converges with visual reproduction in this new era, fulfilling Paul Valéry's prophecy: "Just as water, gas, and electricity are brought into our houses from far off to satisfy our needs in response to a minimal effort, so we shall be supplied with visual or auditory images, which will appear and disappear at a simple gesture, hardly more than a sign."

By the turn of the 21st century, Generative AI had attained a level of sophistication that not only allowed it to replicate all transmitted works of art, thereby effecting the most profound change in their impact upon the public; it also secured a distinct place among artistic processes. To understand this milestone, nothing is more illuminating than examining the nature of the repercussions that these two different manifestations—the AI-generated works of art and the art of AI in film—have had on art in its traditional form.

## II

In the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), even the most sophisticated AI-generated artwork lacks one crucial element: the presence in time and space, its unique existence at the point of its creation. This unique existence of the artwork shapes its history throughout its lifespan. This encompasses both the physical alterations it may undergo over time and the shifts in its ownership. The nuances of the former can only be unveiled through chemical or physical analyses, which are impossible to perform on a digital creation; shifts in ownership are part of a tradition that is disconnected from the situation of the AI-generated original.

The concept of authenticity, thus, becomes a prerequisite that is inherently absent in AI-generated art. Authenticity might be determined in traditional art through analyses, such as examining the patina on a bronze or verifying a medieval manuscript's origin from a 15th-century archive. However, the entire domain of authenticity remains beyond the reach of technical—and certainly not just technical—reproducibility in the context of AI.

Faced with its manual reproduction, traditionally deemed a forgery, the original maintains all its authority; this is not the case with technical reproduction through AI. The reason is twofold. First, AI reproduction operates with a level of detachment from the original unseen in manual reproduction. For instance, AI can highlight aspects of an original that are imperceptible to the human eye, capturing nuances that manual techniques cannot. AI-generated art, through processes like algorithmic interpretation or enhancement, can reveal dimensions of the original that escape natural perception. Secondly, AI reproduction can place the copy of the original into contexts unreachable by the original itself. Most importantly, it allows the original to encounter the observer in a new form, whether as a digital image or a synthesized piece of music. The artwork transcends its physical confines to meet the art lover in a virtual space; a symphony, once confined to a concert hall, now unfolds in the digital realm.

The contexts into which AI-generated art is introduced may not directly affect the physical artwork, yet the quality of its presence is invariably diminished. This is true not only for artworks but also for natural landscapes rendered through digital screens. In the case of art, the most affected aspect is its authenticity—the essence of all that is transmissible from its inception, from its material longevity to its historical witness. As the historical testimony hinges on authenticity, it too is compromised by AI reproduction when the importance of material duration fades. What is at stake when historical testimony is undermined is the object's authority.

This loss might be encapsulated in the term "aura," leading to the observation: what diminishes in the age of Generative AI is the artwork's aura. This symptomatic process has implications extending beyond art. It could be generalized that the technique of AI reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the realm of tradition. By generating numerous copies, it replaces the unique existence with a multitude of iterations. And by allowing the reproduction to interact with the observer in their personal context, it revitalizes the reproduced object. These dynamics contribute to a profound disruption of tradition, which mirrors the contemporary crisis and renewal of humanity. These transformations are deeply intertwined with modern mass movements, with Generative AI serving as a pivotal force. Its societal impact, especially in its most constructive guise, cannot be fully grasped without acknowledging its role in dismantling the traditional valuation of cultural heritage. This effect is vividly observable in historical recreations through AI, expanding to ever-new frontiers. In a prophetic exclamation, one might imagine a future where the greats of the past—Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Beethoven—are resurrected through AI, all myths and legends reborn in digital form, heralding an extensive reevaluation of our cultural legacies.

Throughout extensive epochs of history, the way humans perceive the world—our mode of sense perception—evolves alongside humanity's overall way of life. This organization of perception, the context within which it operates, is shaped not solely by natural forces but also by the historical conditions of the time. The fifth century, marked by significant population shifts, witnessed the emergence of the late Roman art industry and the creation of the Vienna Genesis, heralding not just a departure from ancient art forms but the advent of a novel kind of sensory perception. Scholars from the Viennese school, notably Riegl and Wickhoff, who challenged the heavy mantle of classical tradition that had obscured these later artistic expressions, were pioneers in deducing insights about the organization of perception in that era. Despite their profound understanding, these scholars confined their analyses to identifying the distinct formal characteristics of perception in late Roman times, without delving into the social transformations that these perceptual changes might signify. Today, the conditions for such an analysis appear more favorable. If the contemporary shift in perception can be understood as the erosion of the aura, then it's feasible to identify its social underpinnings.

The notion of aura, as previously discussed in relation to historical artifacts, can also be elucidated through the aura surrounding natural phenomena. We describe the aura of natural objects as the unique phenomenon of a distance, no matter how immediate it may seem. For instance, if you spend a summer afternoon gazing at a distant mountain range on the horizon or a branch casting its shadow over you, you're experiencing the aura of those mountains, of that branch. This analogy facilitates an understanding of the social foundations underlying the modern decay of the aura. This decay is rooted in two related developments, both tied to the growing influence of the masses in contemporary society. First is the masses' desire to diminish the spatial and emotional distance between themselves and objects, a desire as intense as their inclination to negate the singularity of every reality by embracing its reproduction. The contemporary drive to possess an object through its likeness, its reproduction, is becoming increasingly insistent. Clearly, the reproduction provided by picture magazines and newsreels presents a different experience from that of viewing the object directly with the naked eye. In the direct experience, uniqueness and permanence are intertwined, whereas in reproduction, transience and replicability are the dominant features. To extract an object from its context, to dismantle its aura, signifies a mode of perception where the 'sense of the universal equality of things' has grown so pronounced that it seeks to replicate even the unique object through reproduction. This phenomenon in the realm of perception mirrors what is observed in the theoretical domain with the rising prominence of statistics. The mutual adaptation of reality to the masses and the masses to reality represents a process of boundless extent, affecting both thought and perception alike.

## IV

The uniqueness of a work of art is deeply intertwined with its integration into the continuum of tradition. This tradition is vibrant and subject to flux. Consider an ancient statue of Venus: to the Greeks, it was a revered object; to the Medieval clerics, a suspect idol. Yet, both groups engaged with its distinct aura, its unique presence. Historically, the embedding of art within tradition was manifest in its role within the cult. The earliest artworks emerged from ritualistic contexts—initially magical, later religious. The connection of the artwork's aura to its ritualistic origins underscores that the “authentic” value of art is rooted in its ceremonial utility. Even when secularized, this ritualistic foundation can be discerned within the most profane embodiments of the beauty cult.

The transformation of this ritualistic basis during the Renaissance into the secular cult of beauty, persisting for three centuries, highlighted its decline and foreshadowed the first major crisis it would face. The advent of truly revolutionary means of reproduction, such as photography, coincided with the emergence of socialism, signaling to art the onset of a crisis that would become fully apparent a century later. In response, art adopted the doctrine of l’art pour l’art, essentially a theology of art, which led to the emergence of a "negative theology" in the guise of ‘pure’ art. This notion rejected any social utility of art and refused to categorize it by subject matter, a stance first epitomized by Mallarmé in poetry.

In analyzing art in the age of Generative Artificial Intelligence, it is crucial to acknowledge these dynamics, for they offer a critical insight: for the first time in history, Generative AI liberates the work of art from its parasitic reliance on ritual. Increasingly, the artwork generated by AI is designed with reproducibility in mind. From a single algorithmic model, countless variations can be produced; thus, seeking the ‘authentic’ iteration becomes an obsolete endeavor. The moment the criterion of authenticity no longer applies to art's creation, the entire purpose of art undergoes a fundamental shift. Rather than deriving from ritual, art's basis starts to pivot towards another practice—politics.

This shift signifies not just a technological advancement but a profound reorientation of art's role and significance. As Generative AI continues to evolve, it challenges and redefines our understanding of creativity, originality, and the very essence of art itself. In this new era, art transcends its traditional boundaries, engaging with and reflecting the complexities of contemporary life in unprecedented ways.

## V

The reception and valuation of art oscillate between two distinct poles: on one end, the emphasis lies on the art's cult value, and on the other, its exhibition value takes precedence. Artistic endeavors originally emerged from the creation of ceremonial objects intended for use within sacred rites. The primary concern was their existence rather than their visibility. For instance, the prehistoric man who etched an elk onto his cave wall was engaging in a form of magic, aimed more at communing with spirits than with human spectators. In contemporary terms, the cult value of an artwork might suggest it remains obscured from public view. Certain divine statues are only revealed to priests in the sanctum of a temple; some revered Madonnas are veiled for the majority of the year; and specific sculptures on medieval cathedrals elude the gaze of those at ground level.

As art practices liberated themselves from ritualistic constraints, the opportunities for displaying their creations expanded. It became simpler to exhibit a portrait bust that could be transported and displayed in various locations than to showcase a deity's statue anchored within the temple's sacred confines. This principle extends to the evolution of painting from the mosaic or fresco, and even though a mass and a symphony might have initially shared similar levels of public accessibility, the symphony emerged at a point when its potential for public presentation was set to eclipse that of the mass.

With the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the reproduction of art, the capacity for exhibition has surged to such a degree that the balance between the artwork's cult and exhibition values has undergone a qualitative metamorphosis. This shift mirrors the transformation seen in prehistoric times when art, primarily valued for its magical or cult significance, gradually came to be appreciated as art per se. Similarly, in the current era, by placing an absolute emphasis on its exhibition value, art morphs into an entity with entirely novel functions, among which the artistic function we presently acknowledge may eventually be deemed secondary. It is unequivocal that today, Generative AI stands as the most potent manifestation of this new function, heralding a future where the exhibition value of art, propelled by technological advancements, invites us to reconsider the very essence of what art is and what it is for.

## VI

In the domain of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the transition from cult value to exhibition value is pronounced, yet it encounters resistance. Cult value, steadfast in its nature, finds its last refuge in the human countenance. It is no mere coincidence that AI-generated portraiture has emerged as a significant focus of early generative art. The tradition of memorializing loved ones, whether they are distant or have passed away, represents the final stronghold for the image's cult value in this new era. In these early AI-generated images, the aura is perceived one last time in the ephemeral expressions of human faces, lending them a melancholy and unmatched beauty. However, as the presence of the human element begins to fade from the AI-generated image, the exhibition value overtakes the ritual value for the first time.

The acknowledgment of this crucial evolution is the unparalleled contribution of artists who, at the dawn of the 21st century, utilized AI to capture scenes devoid of human presence, much like Atget did with his photographs of deserted Parisian streets. Their work could be likened to documenting scenes of absence, where the absence itself is recorded for the purpose of creating evidence. Through the lens of Generative AI, these images become standard bearers for historical narratives, carrying an implicit political weight. They necessitate a unique form of engagement; they are not merely for passive observation. They challenge the viewer, demanding a novel form of interaction.

Simultaneously, the rise of digital platforms begins to guide the viewer's interpretation, whether through algorithmically generated recommendations or user-driven content. The necessity for captions or textual accompaniments becomes paramount, marking a new departure from the traditional naming of artworks. These textual guides shape the viewer's understanding of AI-generated art, a directive that becomes even more pronounced and obligatory in digital narratives and interactive art. In these new forms, the meaning of each piece is seemingly shaped by the algorithmic sequence of all that precede it, directing the viewer along a preordained path of engagement.

## VII

The nineteenth-century debate over the artistic merit of painting versus photography now appears misguided and perplexing. Yet, this does not detract from its significance; rather, it emphasizes it. This debate was actually indicative of a historical shift whose universal implications were not fully grasped by either party involved. When the era of mechanical reproduction detached art from its ritualistic roots, any illusion of its autonomy was permanently dispelled. The alteration in art's function extended beyond the outlook of that century and eluded even the twentieth century, which witnessed the advent of cinema. Initially, much effort was wasted on debating whether photography could be considered art. The more critical question—whether the invention of photography had fundamentally altered the nature of art itself—went unasked. Soon, film theorists were pondering the same misguided question about cinema. The challenges that photography posed to traditional aesthetics were minor compared to the upheaval brought about by cinema, leading to the somewhat crude and forced nature of early film theories.

For instance, Abel Gance likened cinema to hieroglyphs, suggesting a regression to the expressive level of the Egyptians, arguing that pictorial language was still immature because our eyes had not yet adapted to it. He believed there was not enough reverence for what cinema could express. Séverin-Mars envisioned cinema as a medium capable of conveying the most poetic and realistic dreams, accessible only to the most elevated individuals during the most profound and mysterious moments of their lives. Alexandre Arnoux, musing on silent film, equated its essence to that of prayer, highlighting how the push to categorize film as an "art" led theorists to awkwardly impose ritualistic elements onto it.

These speculations emerged even as films like "L’Opinion Publique" and "The Gold Rush" were being released, showcasing cinema's potential beyond the constraints of early theories. Yet, this did not prevent Abel Gance from drawing parallels with hieroglyphs, nor Séverin-Mars from discussing cinema as if it were akin to Fra Angelico's paintings. Interestingly, even today, some ultraconservative critics attribute a quasi-sacred, if not outright supernatural, significance to cinema. Werfel, commenting on Max Reinhardt’s film adaptation of "A Midsummer Night’s Dream," lamented that cinema's preoccupation with merely duplicating the external world had prevented it from ascending to the status of art. He argued that cinema had yet to realize its true essence and possibilities, which lie in its unparalleled ability to naturally and convincingly portray the fantastical, the marvelous, and the supernatural.

Transitioning this discussion to the context of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in art production, we encounter a similar paradigm shift. The debate over the artistic value of traditional mediums versus AI-generated art echoes the past disputes between painting and photography, and later, cinema. Just as the advent of photography and film challenged and expanded the boundaries of art, so does Generative AI today. It prompts us to reconsider the essence of creativity and the nature of art in the digital age. The initial skepticism and theoretical clumsiness that greeted photography and film find their parallels in the contemporary discourse on AI in art, suggesting that we are once again at the cusp of a significant evolution in how art is conceived, created, and appreciated.

The artistic performance of a stage actor is directly conveyed to the audience by the actor in person; in contrast, the performance of an actor in AI-generated media is mediated by algorithms, leading to a twofold consequence. The algorithms that render the performance of the digital actor to the audience do not need to maintain the performance as an unbroken whole. Guided by the developers and data scientists, the AI continually alters its interpretation of the performance. The sequence of generated scenes which the AI composes from the data provided to it results in the completed piece. This includes certain elements of movement that are, in reality, those of the AI, not to mention specialized effects like digital zooms and perspectives. Thus, the performance of the actor is subjected to a series of computational analyses. This is the first consequence of the fact that the actor’s performance is presented through generative artificial intelligence.

Moreover, the digital actor lacks the opportunity of the stage actor to respond to the audience during the performance, since the presentation is not made in person. This allows the audience to adopt the role of a critic, without forming any personal connection with the performer. The audience's identification with the actor becomes, in essence, an identification with the algorithm. Consequently, the audience assumes the perspective of the AI; its approach is that of evaluation. This is not the stance from which cult values can be appreciated.

## IX

In the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the essence of performance undergoes a profound transformation, much like the shift observed by Pirandello in the context of film acting. Pirandello keenly observed the actor's alienation in the face of the camera, a sentiment that resonates even more deeply when considering the actor's interaction with AI technologies. His reflections, though initially focused on the silent film's limitations, retain their relevance in discussions about AI's impact on performance art. The core issue remains: the performance is rendered not for a live audience but for a digital apparatus, which in the era of AI, becomes even more complex than the simple camera and microphone setup of sound films.

Pirandello described the film actor as feeling exiled, not just from the stage but from his own essence, experiencing a disconcerting void as his physical presence is distilled into a fleeting digital image, devoid of life and voice, only to disappear into the digital ether. This scenario is intensified in the context of AI, where the actor's performance is not only captured but can be algorithmically altered, creating a version of the performance that may bear little resemblance to the original enactment. "The AI projector plays with his shadow," Pirandello might say, underscoring the actor's relegation to performing in solitude before an array of sensors and processors.

This dynamic marks a pivotal shift: for the first time, the performer engages with his entire being in a process that strips away the aura inherent to live performance. The aura, that elusive quality tied to the performer's physical presence, cannot be replicated or transmitted through AI. The unique aura that envelops a stage actor, merging indistinguishably with the character they portray, dissipates when the performance is mediated by AI. The camera, in the studio setting, replaces the audience, erasing the aura surrounding both actor and character.

Pirandello's insights inadvertently touch upon the broader crisis facing the theatre and performance art in the age of AI. The stark contrast between live stage plays and art forms steeped in digital reproduction becomes glaringly evident. The industry acknowledges that the most impactful film performances often result from minimalistic acting, a principle that becomes even more pronounced in AI-mediated performances. Rudolf Arnheim's observation that the trend involves treating the actor as a mere prop, selected for specific traits and inserted into the scene at the right moment, underscores the fragmented nature of AI-influenced acting.

The film actor's inability to fully identify with their role, a challenge exacerbated by AI, results from the piecemeal construction of their performance. Various practical considerations—studio costs, availability of co-actors, and set design—alongside the technical demands of lighting and equipment, fragment the actor's work into discrete segments that can be algorithmically assembled. For instance, a startled reaction to a knock might be captured separately, with the actor unaware of the impending sound, to ensure authenticity. This method highlights the departure from the "beautiful semblance" traditionally associated with art, venturing into a realm where the essence of performance is dissected and reassembled by digital means, challenging our perceptions of authenticity and the very nature of artistic expression.

## X

The disorientation actors feel in front of a camera, as Pirandello poignantly observes, is akin to the alienation one experiences before their own image in a mirror. However, with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this reflection has not only become detachable and transportable but also mutable. And its ultimate destination? The public sphere. Actors engaging with AI-driven performances are acutely aware of this reality; as they perform in front of AI technologies, they understand that their performances, potentially altered or enhanced by algorithms, will ultimately be presented to an audience, the consumers who constitute the market. This market, to which they offer not just their labor but their entire essence—heart, soul, and now digital likeness—is as remote from them during the AI processing as any product is from its creator in a factory setting. This detachment might amplify the sense of oppression, the novel anxiety that grips the actor in the age of AI, as described by Pirandello.

In response to the erosion of aura in the digital age, the film industry, now intertwined with AI, crafts an artificial persona outside the studio. The cult of the movie star, sustained by the industry's financial might, no longer preserves the unique aura of the individual but rather the "charm of the personality," a synthetic allure of a commodified digital entity. As long as the capital behind AI-driven movie production dictates trends, the revolutionary potential of contemporary cinema is primarily to foster a revolutionary critique of traditional art concepts. While acknowledging that some AI-enhanced films may challenge social conditions and the distribution of property, this discussion does not delve deeper into such aspects, any more than does the AI-enhanced film production in Western Europe.

The nature of film, now deeply integrated with AI, inherently positions every viewer as a potential critic or creator. This phenomenon is evident when considering how AI democratizes the creation and critique of film, making expert analysis and participation accessible to all. Just as the newsreel once offered every passerby the chance to rise from observer to movie extra, AI in cinema suggests that anyone could find themselves, or a version of themselves, within a work of art, echoing the participatory ethos seen in Vertov’s "Three Songs About Lenin" or Ivens's "Borinage". Today, virtually anyone can aspire to be digitally recreated or have their performance enhanced by AI. This shift is best understood by comparing it to the historical evolution of contemporary literature.

For centuries, a small cadre of writers addressed thousands of readers. This dynamic began to shift with the expansion of the press and has been revolutionized by the internet and AI, turning an increasing number of readers into writers, initially on an occasional basis. This transformation was accelerated by platforms inviting user-generated content, including comments, reviews, and personal narratives. Nowadays, it's rare to find a person who couldn't, in principle, publish their thoughts or creative work online. Thus, the traditional divide between author and audience is dissolving, becoming more a matter of function than of inherent distinction, with the reader frequently transitioning into a writer. In the realm of AI, giving voice to work itself becomes integral to one's ability to perform it, with literary and artistic expression founded on a broad rather than specialized education, thereby democratizing creativity.

This paradigm shift, observed in literature over centuries, has occurred within a decade in cinema, particularly in contexts where AI has become part of the creative process. In Russia and beyond, this evolution has partially become a reality, with individuals in films not just acting but also contributing to or co-creating their digital personas, especially within their own labor processes. In contrast, in Western Europe and elsewhere, the capitalist exploitation of AI in film often overlooks the legitimate claim of individuals to be authentically represented, focusing instead on generating mass interest through illusionary spectacles and speculative ventures powered by AI.

## XI

The creation of art through Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a spectacle that was unimaginable in any previous era. It unfolds a process where the traditional spectator's viewpoint is fundamentally altered, not by the physical intrusion of camera equipment and lighting machinery, but by the invisible, yet pervasive, influence of algorithms and data processing. This shift highlights a profound transformation in the relationship between the scene being created and its perception. In the theater, the audience is keenly aware of a perspective from which the play's illusion might not be immediately discernible. In the realm of AI-generated art, such a perspective is entirely redefined. The illusion crafted by AI is of a nuanced order, shaped by data interpretation and algorithmic processing. Here, the intrusion of technology into reality is so profound that the aspect of reality, once mediated by tangible equipment, now emerges from a complex interplay of software algorithms. The reality free from the overt presence of machinery thus becomes the ultimate artifice; the unmediated observation of reality transforms into a rarefied artifact in the domain of digital technology.

This divergence from traditional film and theater becomes even more pronounced when juxtaposed with the practice of painting. The inquiry then becomes: How does the role of the AI programmer or data scientist compare to that of the painter? To explore this, we might consider an analogy with surgery. The surgeon stands in contrast to the magician. The magician seeks to heal with a mere touch, maintaining a natural distance yet slightly bridging it with his presence, thereby enhancing it through his aura of authority. Conversely, the surgeon diminishes the distance between himself and the patient by penetrating the patient's body, navigating carefully among the organs. Unlike the magician, who cloaks his process in the guise of traditional healing, the surgeon, at the critical moment, bypasses direct engagement with the patient, instead entering into them through the operation.

This analogy extends to the painter and the AI developer. The painter maintains a natural distance from reality, while the AI developer delves deeply into the fabric of data. The images produced are fundamentally different: the painter offers a cohesive, unified vision, whereas the AI generates art from a multitude of data points, reassembled under a new algorithmic law. For the contemporary observer, AI's representation of reality, precisely because of its deep integration with data and algorithms, offers a perspective of reality ostensibly liberated from any mechanical apparatus. This, then, is what we might seek from a work of art in the age of AI: a rendition of reality that transcends the visible and invisible presence of the technology that crafted it, offering a new orchid in the technologized landscape of art.

## XII

The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in art fundamentally transforms the masses' engagement with art forms. The traditional, perhaps reactionary, reception of a Picasso painting evolves into a progressive interaction with an AI-generated film or artwork. This progressive interaction is marked by a seamless, intimate melding of visual and emotional gratification with the discernment of the expert. Such a synthesis holds profound social implications. As the social significance of an art form wanes, the gap between public criticism and enjoyment widens: the conventional is consumed without scrutiny, while the genuinely innovative is met with resistance. However, in the realm of AI-generated art, the critical and receptive stances of the audience merge. The key to this convergence lies in the fact that individual reactions are shaped by the anticipated collective response of the mass audience, a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in AI-enhanced cinema. Once these reactions are expressed, they regulate one another.

Drawing a parallel with painting illuminates this shift. Traditionally, a painting was likely to be viewed alone or by a small group. The nineteenth-century trend of mass public engagement with paintings signaled an early crisis in the medium, a crisis not solely triggered by photography but also by the intrinsic mass appeal of artworks.

Painting, by its nature, is ill-equipped to offer an object for simultaneous collective experience, unlike architecture, the epic poem of yesteryears, or the AI-generated film of today. While this fact alone does not dictate the social role of painting, it poses a significant threat when painting, under specific conditions and contrary to its essence, is directly exposed to the masses. In the Middle Ages, within churches and monasteries, and at princely courts until the late eighteenth century, paintings were received collectively but not simultaneously, mediated through a structured and hierarchical system. The shift observed reflects the unique conflict painting faces due to the digital reproducibility afforded by Generative AI. Even as paintings began to be publicly displayed in galleries and salons, there was no mechanism for the masses to collectively orchestrate and modulate their reception. Consequently, the same public that engages progressively with an AI-generated grotesque film might react conservatively to surrealism, showcasing the transformative impact of Generative AI on public perception and interaction with art.

## XIII

The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in art does not merely change how humans interact with machines but also revolutionizes how, through these digital intermediaries, humans can depict their world. Insights from occupational psychology demonstrate the evaluative power of technology, while psychoanalysis offers a different lens, showing how AI enriches our perception with methods akin to those of Freudian theory. Just as Freud's work brought unnoticed slips of the tongue into sharp relief, revealing the depths beneath seemingly superficial conversations, AI in art deepens our apperception across the entire spectrum of visual and auditory perception. This is the flip side of the fact that behaviors depicted through AI-generated content can be dissected with greater precision and from more angles than those captured in paintings or performed on stage. Compared to painting, AI-mediated behavior allows for a more detailed exposition of context, and unlike stage performances, it can be isolated and analyzed with ease.

This development is crucial for fostering the interplay between art and science. The detailed portrayal of behavior in specific situations by AI, akin to isolating a muscle in the human body, blurs the line between its artistic and scientific value. Demonstrating the convergence of artistic and scientific applications of AI, traditionally seen as distinct, stands as one of the revolutionary roles of AI in art.

AI, through its ability to zoom in on the minutiae of our surroundings, to uncover the hidden aspects of familiar objects, and to navigate the ordinary with a novel perspective, on one hand, broadens our understanding of the forces governing our lives. On the other, it assures us of a vast and surprising realm of possibilities. The mundane environments that seemed to confine us are transformed by AI, breaking open the "prison-world" with the metaphorical dynamite of digital innovation, leaving us to explore the remnants with a sense of calm adventure. With AI, space is not just enlarged; it is redefined. Slow motion and zoom not only clarify but unveil entirely new structures within the subject. What was once a mere enlargement of a snapshot by AI reveals new formations, just as slow motion uncovers not just slowed movements but motions that appear to defy our understanding of physics, suggesting a glide or float that feels almost supernatural.

A different aspect of reality is laid bare to the camera than to the naked eye, partly because AI allows us to access spaces and dynamics unconsciously, replacing direct human exploration with a digitally mediated one. Even if we think we understand how people move, AI shows us the intricacies of a stride or the interaction between hand and object in ways that fluctuate with emotional states—details previously beyond our conscious awareness. Here, AI intervenes with its digital manipulations—zooms, cuts, speed adjustments, and perspective shifts—introducing us to a realm of unconscious optics as psychoanalysis reveals unconscious impulses.

Art's enduring mission has been to cultivate a demand that finds its fulfillment only in the future. The trajectory of each art form is marked by pivotal moments when it reaches for effects that can only be fully realized with a shift in technological paradigms, heralding the advent of a new art form. The apparent excesses and crudities that emerge in what are often termed as decadent periods of art are, in reality, expressions of its most dynamic historical forces. In recent times, such "barbarisms" found a prolific outlet in Dadaism, which, with hindsight, can be recognized as an attempt to achieve through pictorial and literary means the effects that today's audience seeks in the realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Every groundbreaking, innovative creation of demands inevitably overshoots its intended mark. Dadaism did so by forgoing the market values typically associated with cinema in pursuit of higher aspirations—though such intentions were not consciously articulated as described here. Dadaists placed far less emphasis on the commercial value of their work than on its utility for contemplative immersion. The deliberate degradation of their materials was one of their methods to attain this state of "uselessness." Their creations, be it "word salads" filled with linguistic refuse or paintings adorned with everyday objects, aimed at a systematic dismantling of the aura of their creations, marking them as reproductions through their very mode of production.

Facing an Arp painting or an August Stramm poem, one is deprived of the opportunity for contemplation and judgment that might be afforded by a canvas of Derain or a poem by Rilke. In the waning days of bourgeois society, contemplation became a pathway to antisocial behavior, replaced by distraction as a mode of social engagement. Dadaist ventures ensured intense distraction by making art the nucleus of scandal. Their primary aim was to shock the public. Transforming from an appealing visual or a compelling auditory structure into a ballistic device, Dadaist art impacted the viewer with the force of a bullet, thereby acquiring a tactile presence. This tactile essence fostered a demand for AI-generated art, whose power of distraction also primarily stems from tactile experiences, driven by the algorithmic manipulation of data that continually engages the viewer.

Contrasting the canvas of a painting with the digital screen displaying AI-generated art reveals fundamental differences in the viewer's engagement. A painting invites contemplation, allowing viewers to dive into their thoughts and associations. In contrast, the AI-generated art piece offers no such reprieve; the viewer's engagement is constantly reshaped by algorithmic interventions. This relentless alteration of content, as might be observed by critics of AI who are yet to grasp its full significance, disrupts the viewer's thought processes, replacing them with a dynamically evolving stream of digital constructs. The rapid succession of algorithmically generated images interrupts the viewer's associative thinking, creating a shock effect akin to physical jolts, which, according to theory, necessitates a heightened mental alertness to be mitigated.

Through its algorithmic foundation, AI-generated art extracts and amplifies the physical shock effect, previously encapsulated within the moral shock of Dadaism, presenting it anew to the viewer in a digitally mediated form.

The digital milieu acts as a crucible from which contemporary interactions with art emerge, transformed. The sheer scale of engagement has shifted the paradigm from quantity to quality, altering how participation is manifested. The emergence of this new form of engagement in its nascent, often criticized form, should not be dismissed lightly. Yet, critics like Duhamel have vehemently denounced this superficial aspect, particularly targeting the mode of engagement elicited by Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in art. Duhamel decries AI-generated art as entertainment for the downtrodden, a mindless diversion for those overwhelmed by their daily struggles, requiring no intellectual effort, igniting no inspiration, and fostering only the futile hope of achieving celebrity within the digital realm. This critique echoes the age-old complaint that the masses seek distraction, whereas true art necessitates focused contemplation from its audience—a notion that has become a truism.

However, the question of whether this critique provides a solid foundation for analyzing AI in art remains. This necessitates a more nuanced examination. Distraction and concentration represent two ends of a spectrum: where concentrated contemplation leads one to be absorbed by the artwork, akin to the legend of the Chinese painter lost in his own creation, the distracted masses, conversely, absorb the artwork. This dynamic is most evident in architecture, the quintessential form of art consumed collectively in a state of distraction, offering valuable insights into the laws of artistic reception.

Since time immemorial, buildings have accompanied humanity, outliving numerous art forms that have blossomed and faded. While tragedies and epic poems have their epochs, and panel painting its era, the fundamental human need for shelter endures, ensuring architecture's perpetual relevance. Its ancient lineage and ongoing vitality offer a key to understanding the mass's relationship with art. Buildings are engaged with both through use (touch) and perception (sight), not with the focused attention of a tourist before a landmark, but through habitual interaction. This tactile engagement, governed more by habit than by deliberate attention, significantly shapes even our visual reception of architecture, often occurring through casual, incidental observation rather than through studious observation.

Habitual engagement, even in a state of distraction, can lead to the formation of habits. Indeed, the capacity to navigate tasks distractedly indicates their assimilation into habit. Art's provision of distraction serves as a subtle gauge for assessing how new tasks have been integrated into collective perception. As individuals naturally tend to shirk these tasks, art confronts the most challenging and significant among them, particularly when it can galvanize the masses. In the era of AI, this mobilization is achieved through AI-generated art, which, by catering to a mode of reception characterized by increasing distraction across all art forms, signifies profound shifts in perception. AI-generated art, with its inherent capacity to shock and engage, aligns perfectly with this distracted mode of reception. It demotes the cult value of art, not only by positioning the audience as critics but by doing so in a manner that demands no concentrated effort. The audience, though acting as evaluators, does so absent-mindedly.

## EPILOGUE

The burgeoning proletarianization of contemporary society and the concurrent rise of mass formations are dual facets of a singular evolutionary process. Fascism's approach to managing these newly minted proletarian masses—without altering the property structures they aim to overthrow—opts for a superficial engagement. Rather than granting the masses their legitimate rights to transform property relations, Fascism offers them an outlet for expression, all the while safeguarding the existing property regime. This maneuver leads to the inevitable infusion of aesthetics into the political domain, mirroring the subjugation of both the masses, coerced into submission by the cult of leadership, and of technological apparatuses, repurposed to generate ritualistic values.

The zenith of politicizing aesthetics invariably points to war. War alone can align mass movements on an extensive scale while upholding the sanctity of traditional property systems. This forms the crux of the political predicament. From a technological standpoint, the predicament articulates that only war enables the full mobilization of today's technological advancements, including those propelled by Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), without renouncing the property system. Although Fascist glorification of war eschews such analytical discourse, Marinetti's manifesto on the Ethiopian colonial war unabashedly venerates war's aesthetic dimensions. War is celebrated for establishing human dominance over the "subjugated machinery"—now including the digital algorithms and AI systems—transforming the human body into a metallic entity, and for adorning the natural landscape with the "fiery orchids" of machine guns. War, according to Marinetti, engenders new forms of architecture and artistic expression, compelling Futurist poets and artists to imbue their quest for novel literary and artistic paradigms with these principles of war-induced aesthetics.

Marinetti's manifesto, with its stark clarity, demands the attention of dialectical thinkers. Through this lens, the aesthetics of modern warfare, especially as influenced by Generative AI, underscore a profound truth: when the natural deployment of productive forces is stymied by the property system, the escalation in technological means, speed, and energy sources necessitates their unnatural application, found in the domain of war. The destructiveness of war testifies to society's immaturity in integrating technology as an inherent component, suggesting that technology, including AI, has not evolved sufficiently to harmonize with society's elemental forces. The grotesque manifestations of imperialistic warfare stem from the disjunction between immense productive capacities and their inadequate utilization in production, highlighted by unemployment and market deficits. Imperialistic warfare emerges as a revolt of technology, repurposing human lives as "material" in lieu of natural resources. Society, rather than leveraging technology for constructive ends, channels human lives into the maw of warfare, with AI-enhanced strategies erasing the human aura in unprecedented ways.

Fascism declares, "Let art flourish, even to the detriment of the world," and, as Marinetti acknowledges, anticipates war to fulfill the artistic yearnings shaped by technological evolution, including AI. This epitomizes the ultimate realization of "art for art's sake," where humanity, once an object of divine contemplation, now contemplates its own spectacle. Such self-alienation has escalated to the point where humanity can perceive its own destruction as an aesthetic experience of the highest order. This is the aestheticization of politics that Fascism advocates, against which Communism counters by advocating for the politicization of art, including art influenced by Generative Artificial Intelligence.
