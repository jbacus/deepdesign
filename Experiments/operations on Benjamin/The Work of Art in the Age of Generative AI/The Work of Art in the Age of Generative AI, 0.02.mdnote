## PREFACE 
When Marx scrutinized the capitalist mode of production, capitalism was nascent. Marx aimed his critique to forecast capitalism's trajectory, examining its foundational conditions to predict its outcomes. He foresaw not only the intensifying exploitation of the proletariat but also the eventual conditions for capitalism's self-abolition. The transformation of the superstructure, lagging behind the substructure's evolution, has taken decades to permeate cultural domains fully. Only now can we discern its manifestations. These prognostications must meet certain criteria, yet speculations on post-revolutionary art or a classless society's art are less pertinent than observations on art's current developmental tendencies under existing production conditions. The dialectics of art are as evident in the superstructure as in the economy, making it imprudent to undervalue such analysis as a strategic tool. It challenges outdated notions—creativity, genius, eternal value, mystery—whose unchecked application veers towards Fascist data manipulation. The concepts introduced here, unlike more familiar terms, resist Fascist co-optation and instead articulate revolutionary demands in art politics.

## I 
Art has always been replicable. Human-made artifacts have always been subject to imitation. Replicas were crafted by apprentices as part of their training, by masters to disseminate their works, and by third parties for profit. Yet, generative artificial intelligence (AI) introduces a novel form of art replication. Historically, this evolved sporadically, but with AI, the pace is unprecedented. The Greeks had only founding and stamping methods for mass-producing art. All other forms were unique and not subject to mechanical reproduction. With the advent of woodcut, graphic art first became mechanically replicable, predating even the printing press's impact on text reproduction. The profound changes brought by printing to literature are well-documented. However, within the broader historical view, printing is just a specific, albeit crucial, case. The introduction of engraving and etching expanded these methods, and lithography, arriving in the nineteenth century, marked a significant leap by allowing graphic art to rapidly adapt to market demands, mirroring the daily changes in life.

Generative AI, however, transforms art reproduction fundamentally. It liberates creation from the manual constraints that bound earlier art forms, entrusting the creative process to algorithms. For the first time, the creation of visual art does not depend solely on human hands but on data processed through complex algorithms, enabling the production of images at a pace and volume that dwarfs traditional methods. Just as lithography once heralded the illustrated newspaper, generative AI foreshadows a new era where art is not just reproduced but generated anew, challenging our very perceptions of creativity and originality.

## II 
Even the most accurate AI-generated art lacks one element: the presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place it happens to be. This unique existence of the artwork throughout history is what determined its authenticity. This includes the physical changes it underwent and its provenance. The original's presence, essential for its authenticity, is something AI-generated art cannot replicate. Chemical analysis can authenticate a bronze's patina, just as historical documentation can verify a manuscript's age. The realm of authenticity remains beyond the reach of generative AI.

Confronted with manual reproductions, the original maintained its authority, a status not diminished by technical reproduction. The reason is twofold. First, AI-generated art is more detached from the original than manual reproductions. For instance, in photography, the process can highlight aspects invisible to the naked eye but captured by the camera's lens. Similarly, AI can generate art that reveals insights or patterns not immediately apparent to human creators, offering new perspectives on familiar subjects. Secondly, AI-generated art can place the "original" in contexts unreachable by the original itself. It allows the artwork to meet the viewer halfway, whether as a digital image or a printed copy, democratizing access to art but also diluting its presence. This depreciation of presence affects not just the artwork but also the viewer's experience, challenging traditional notions of authenticity and value.

## III 
Throughout history, shifts in human sense perception accompany broader existential changes. The organization of sensory perception, influenced by both nature and historical circumstances, reflects humanity's adaptive responses to its environment. The late Roman period, marked by significant population shifts, saw the emergence of new art forms and perceptual modes, as analyzed by the Viennese school's scholars. Their insights, though profound, did not fully account for the social transformations these perceptual changes signified. Today, the conditions for such an analysis are more favorable, especially in understanding how generative AI impacts our perception of art and its "aura."

The concept of aura, as applied to natural objects, helps illustrate the contemporary decay of aura in art. The aura is that unique phenomenon of distance, however close the object might be. If one considers a mountain range or a branch casting a shadow, the aura is palpable in the physical distance and the experiential gap it creates. Generative AI, by making art more accessible and reproducible, seeks to eliminate this distance, aiming to bring art closer to the masses both spatially and emotionally. This desire aligns with the masses' inclination to bridge distances, to make art more relatable and accessible, thereby challenging the uniqueness and permanence that traditionally characterized art and its reception.

## IV 
The unique value of "authentic" art has its foundation in ritual, the original context for art's use value. This ritualistic basis, though increasingly secularized, remains discernible in art's modern forms. The transition from art rooted in ritual to art aimed at mass reproduction—exemplified by generative AI—reflects a fundamental shift. This shift is not merely quantitative but qualitative, altering the nature of art itself. Generative AI, by producing art designed for reproducibility, challenges traditional concepts of authenticity and uniqueness, making the notion of an "original" increasingly obsolete.

## V 
Art is received and valued on different planes, with one emphasizing cult value and the other exhibition value. The transition from art as a ritualistic object to a widely exhibited product mirrors broader societal changes. Generative AI accelerates this transition, enhancing art's exhibition value to unprecedented levels. This shift not only democratizes access to art but also transforms its social functions, moving away from ritualistic contemplation towards engagement and participation in a mass culture.

## VI 
In the realm of generative AI, the displacement of cult value by exhibition value becomes starkly apparent. However, the transition is not without resistance. The last bastion of cult value, the human countenance, remains a domain where AI struggles to replicate the depth of human expression fully. Early AI-generated portraits retained a semblance of aura, capturing fleeting human emotions. Yet, as AI advances, the exhibition value increasingly overshadows any residual cult value, marking a profound shift in how art is created, perceived, and valued.

## VII 
The debate over the artistic merit of AI-generated art mirrors past disputes between painting and photography. However, this debate misses the crucial point: the advent of generative AI has fundamentally transformed the nature of art itself. Just as photography and film challenged traditional aesthetics, generative AI prompts us to reconsider the very definitions of creativity and originality. The critical question is not whether AI-generated art qualifies as "art" but how it reshapes our understanding of artistic creation and reception in the digital age.

## VIII 
The performance of an actor in traditional theater is an immediate, personal presentation to the audience, contrasting with the mediated performance in AI-generated art. This mediation subjects the actor's performance to digital manipulation, fragmenting and reassembling it in ways that challenge traditional notions of presence and authenticity. The actor, or in this case, the artist, becomes a component in a larger algorithmic process, losing the direct connection with the audience. This shift has profound implications for our understanding of performance and creativity, highlighting the transformative impact of generative AI on the arts.

## IX 
Generative AI fundamentally alters the artist's role, shifting from representing the external world to navigating an internal, algorithmic process. This shift echoes Pirandello's observations on the actor's alienation in film, but with a crucial difference: the artist in the age of generative AI grapples with the loss of direct control over the creative process, engaging instead with an algorithmic collaborator that challenges traditional notions of authorship and creativity.

## X 
The estrangement experienced by the artist in the face of generative AI parallels the alienation of individuals confronting their reflections in digital media. This mediated self-awareness, where one's image and creative output are subject to algorithmic manipulation, underscores the profound changes in how identity and creativity are constructed and perceived in the digital age.

## XI 
The production of AI-generated art, especially when involving complex algorithms and data sets, presents a spectacle of technological prowess that is both fascinating and alienating. This spectacle, far removed from traditional artistic processes, highlights the growing chasm between human creativity and algorithmic production, raising critical questions about the role of the artist and the nature of creativity in a technologically mediated world.

## XII 
Generative AI changes the mass reception of art, fostering a direct engagement that blurs the lines between creator and consumer. This engagement, characterized by a mix of critical and participatory responses, reflects broader shifts in cultural consumption and production. The democratization of artistic creation through AI challenges traditional hierarchies and opens new possibilities for collective creativity and cultural expression.

## EPILOGUE 
The increasing proletarianization of modern man and the formation of masses are facets of the same process. Fascism's attempt to mobilize these masses without altering the underlying property relations finds its counterpart in the aestheticization of politics. Generative AI, by democratizing artistic production and challenging traditional notions of creativity and ownership, offers a potential counterpoint to this trend, suggesting new forms of political and artistic engagement that transcend the limitations of the past.

Generative AI, by reshaping the production, reception, and function of art, invites us to reconsider the relationship between technology, culture, and society. As we navigate this new landscape, the critical insights and theoretical frameworks provided by thinkers like Walter Benjamin remain invaluable tools for understanding the profound transformations that lie ahead.
