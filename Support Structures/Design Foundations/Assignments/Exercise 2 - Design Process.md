For this challenge, you will be designing something for a partner, rapidly going through all the stages of the Design Thinking Process.

Remember that the key thing here is empathy. Do you best to understand your partner.

There are lots of steps involved. Your LA’s will direct you through the process so pay close attention!

## Mapping (5 min.)
Spend 5 minutes mapping out your day yesterday (what you did) with time on the x-axis and your general emotional state (highs vs. lows) on the y-axis. Make note of what you did, and how you felt during those activities.

## Share (5 min. each)
One partner will share their experiences while the the other takes notes, then switch.  
Actively listen to your partner! Don’t interrupt.

---

## Dig Deeper (5 min. each)
Focus on and frame the lowest part of your partner’s day. Ask “why” questions. 
Get to the heart of what they are experiencing. This can be hard to do, but it’s what separates finding a mediocre POV from a truly engaging one.

---

## Reframe the Problem (5 min.)
Localize a point in your partner’s day where you could design something to improve their day. Write a “Point of View Problem Statement” out of what you have learned.  
How can I help (partner's name) (verb)?

---

## Prototype (10 min.)
Sketch out 3 possible solutions to this problem using pencil and paper. Make the solutions as different from each other as possible.

---

## Test (5 min.)
Regroup with your partner and share what your solutions. Listen to their feedback and take notes. 
Remember that we are trying to improve these ideas so give feedback like “I wish..” and “I like how..” rather than just “that’s cool.”

---

## Refine (10 min.)
Incorporate the feedback that you received from your partner into a single sketched (analog or digital) prototype.

---

## Document (5 min.)
Write some basic documentation of this process including:
- The POV Statement: what was the original problem you noticed?
- The Solution: What is the name of the solution you designed?
- The Benefit: How will this solution benefit your partner?
---

## Present (5 min.)
Share your final solution with your partner.  
After your partner has shared with you, say thanks! Someone has designed something just for you!

---

## Submit (due 12:00 PM tonight, submit in Canvas)
Combine the following into a single PDF:
- Your sketches
- Notes from all of your interviews with your partner, including a clear POV Statement
- Final prototype images
Upload your PDF to Canvas. Include your partner’s name somewhere on your submission.

## Stretch Goal: Physical Prototype
After your recitation, make a low-res physical prototype of your solution from materials in your home. Include images of this in your PDF.
