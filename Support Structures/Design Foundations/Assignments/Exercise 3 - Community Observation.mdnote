# Observation
Exercise 3

---
## Observe people using the ATLAS lobby space
For the next hour, you will be observing and documenting the way people interact with the space and with one another in the lobby of the ATLAS building.

Watch how people enter, how they exit. Observe how they move through space, and how they interact with others. How long do they stay? What are they doing? Are they alone, or are they interacting with others? What else do you see?

Record your observations on paper, in detail, and as fast as you can.

## Some things to take notice of:
- How do people move through the physical space? What affordances trigger these movements?
- What barriers are there to entry and/or physical/social interaction? Are these intentional?
- Are there any unused spaces and/or ways to activate those unused spaces?
- How could you encourage engagement, play, connectivity, or an alternative use of the space?
