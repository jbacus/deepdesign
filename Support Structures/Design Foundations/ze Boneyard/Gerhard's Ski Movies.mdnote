###  Example: Warren Miller ski movies versus my ski movie 

-   _“Users that innovate can develop exactly what they want , rather than relying on manufacturers to act as their (often very imperfect) agents”_ [von Hippel, 2005]. 
    
       
    Amateurs will  produce artifacts of “different quality” than professionals — these artifacts may be more “meaningful” to specific groups **<<no decontextualized sweet spots>>**   
      
      
    **Gerhard’s ski movie:**  

-   Dreaming about Skiing — [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u3bi9KoDNk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u3bi9KoDNk) 
-   duration: 1:37 minutes 
-   Number of Views:  347   I have made no effort made to advertise it 
-   Prerequisites limited: no helicopters, no special movie cameras,  
-   Very low production values -->  low costs  
-   Value: 

-   Reminder for myself (like photos; documenting the past) 
-   Show it to family and friends; to people who are interested in helicopter skiing 
-   Give other people an idea about my skiing abilities (e.g.: “application material” for joining a group) 

  

**Warren Miller’s Ski movies:** 

-   Warren Miller cranked out 55 ski movies in 55 years and made it look easy. 
-   Examples:
-     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6d9DWvoLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj6d9DWvoLE) 
-   [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqBkf5ibktU&feature=related](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqBkf5ibktU&feature=related)  
    
    Number of Views: 72,364   and 134,671 views — resources: high productions costs; employing professional athletes   
    

**Analysis of the Comparison**

-   it is not an “either  or”, but these artifacts  
-   complement each other  
-   satisfy very different objectives  
-   The net is facilitating the rise of pro-amateurs

  

**my limited Ideas about Sketchup/3D Warehouse/ Building Maker**  
**<<very sketchy>>**  
  
**granularity** of participation  (could be compared to the diagram of "Contributing to Open Source")  refers to the size of the modules, in terms of the time and effort that an individual must invest in producing them  

1.  contributing a model to the 3D warehouse

1.  using  SketchUP  substantial learning effort  
    
2.  using Building Maker (exploiting data from Street View)  
    
3.  using the Sketching facilities in the EDC  
    

3.  rating a model  
    
4.  tagging a model  
    
5.  being a curator establishing a collection  
    
6.  downloading a model to Google Earth  
    
7.  difference between 3D Warehouse and EDC

1.  3D Warehouse: one contribution by one person  populating a warehouse  
    
2.  EDC: focus on creating collaboratively a solution to a complex problems  
    

**retrieved from one of my files: —Conversation with John Bacus (Oct 16):**  
  
**John Bacus**: Officially speaking, we size the SketchUp user community as including "over 1 million unique users in the last seven days". Unofficially, I can say that we have had over 15 million users in the last 12 months.  
  
**recent extensions:**  

-   the base maps are not owned by Google  so they can allow users to make modifications (e.g.: adding unknown walking or bike paths) — in the past this was only possible for outside of the USA  
    
-   **new things:** We've gotten some big releases out in the last few weeks, containing a number of new things relevant to your area of interest. Most notably,

-   a new release of SketchUp that gives users a way to model from Street View imagery  
    
-    an entirely new user-editable base map for Google Maps/Earth, and  
    
-   **Building Maker**- a new tool for modeling buildings in Google Earth from oblique imagery.  [http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/buildingmaker](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/buildingmaker)

-   Google makes the decision how they want to act on proposed product ideas  
    

-   relate it to our diagram of **High-Functionality Environments** — product ideas come from D3 and D4

-   how do people keep up with the constant flow of innovations and new features (compare to developments in SmartGrid and Energy sustainability environments)  
    
-   the transition from “citizen”  consumer (being aware what exist, what is possible) in our ecology diagram requires a **major** effort  
    

-   check out: Help Forum  similar to SAP Community Network (see our C&T paper)

-   September Workshop with 30 invited **supermodellers:**

-   background: professionals, hobbyists, students, retired people (Rifkin’s  “third sector and our “Labor/Work” paper)  
    
-   mostly determined by the numbers of models contributed rather than the quality of the contributed models  
    
-   see profile pages —example = John:  [http://www.google.com/profiles/jbacus](http://www.google.com/profiles/jbacus)  
    
-   make the list of supermodellers available to invite friendly competition among participants  
    
-   examples: the two Antwerpen guys:

-   ratings  bug reporters  bug fixers (see open source diagram)

-   Google takes “crash reports” seriously  
    
-   ratings are very simple contributions (think about it from “utility = value / effort” perspective  
    

-   studying Long Tail aspects  of the 3D Warehouse  John will send me a report called “SketchUp Islands”  
    
-   we will arrange a hands-on workshop with John and Brian (developer of Building Maker) with us  
    
-   the “automate”  “informate  (human involvement” spectrum

-   they try to automate as much as possible  e.g.: polygon count of a model  
    
-   but qualitative dimensions need human attention  
    
-   example to think with: Autocorrect in MS word

-   EHR   Her
