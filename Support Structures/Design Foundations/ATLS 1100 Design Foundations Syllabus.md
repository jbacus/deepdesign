### Attendance

Attendance doesn't directly affect your grade, but if you don't attend the Lectures you won't be able to take the Quizzes and if you don't attend your Recitation you won't be able to complete your weekly Design Challenge which are significant parts of your grade. You won't do well in this class if you don't attend regularly and I don't record the lectures. I advise missing no more than one lecture and one recitation.

## Course Description

_Introduces foundational principles, practices, and methods of design. Emphasizes design as a creative problem-solving tool. This engages with “design” from a very broad perspective including visual, physical, and auditory design practices. Through lectures, discussions, and creative projects, students will gain a familiarity with diverse applications and practices related to creative technology and design._

The goal of this course is to teach students how to use fundamental design concepts effectively and compellingly in their work. Through lectures, class discussions, in-class exercises, projects, and critiques, this course will cover the critical, theoretical, and technical skill sets necessary to become a more engaging, empathetic, and articulate designer.

## Course Objectives

Students who complete this course will:

#### Critical Thinking & Theory / History:

-   Gain vocabulary to discuss and analyze design fundamentals
-   Build knowledge on the history of design techniques and practices

#### Design/Creative:

-   Improve communication skills through 2D and 3D design principles

#### Technical:

-   Develop analog and digital tools for design prototyping

## Design Foundation Assignments:

**Assignment**

**Points**

[**Description**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUhp1hEuYXa83Zt5XNEs_QIcho3Be71J3PMXwbOFyjssWang/viewform?usp=send_form)

**Quizzes**

15 points (15 quizzes worth 1 point each)

I will be giving brief quizzes administered on Canvas during the Lectures. The quizzes are password-protected, so the only way you can complete the quiz is to come to class. The goal of the quizzes is to ensure you are prepared for class and to encourage lecture attendance.  
  
You can complete these quizzes on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Email me if you don't have access to a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

**Design Challenges**

30 points total  (~10 Design Challenges worth 3 points each)

Each week we will cover a topic related to the fundamental principles of design. These lectures will be supplemented with a weekly Design Challenge, which will be introduced during your recitation.  
  
These are in-class assignments. You won't be able to make these up if you don't attend your Recitation.  
  
Your lowest score on a Design Challenge will be dropped from your overall grade.

**Design Projects**

40 points total (2 Design Projects worth 20 points each)

There will be 2 major multi-week group projects, one at midterm and one at the end of the semester.

**Observations**

10 points total (2 Observations worth 5 points each)

Twice during this semester, you will actively observe the people and world around you. The best designers are those that understand people, and this exercise (which will also be applied to the larger projects) will increase your skill in this area.

**Total**

**95 points***

*The final total may change during the semester.

### Late Work
