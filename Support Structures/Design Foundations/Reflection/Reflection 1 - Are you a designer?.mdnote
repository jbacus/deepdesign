# Are you a designer?
What thoughts did today's lecture spark in your mind? Are there things you agree with, or (more interestingly) perhaps some things that you _don't_ agree with? What would you say is the main thing that you'll remember from today's material?

What is an example of something you have designed? It doesn't have to be something graphical, or even something visual. Using the definition of design we discussed in class today, write a personal reflection on something you have designed, and why you designed it.
