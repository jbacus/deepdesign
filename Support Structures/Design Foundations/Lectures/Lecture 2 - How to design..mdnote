Design as a practice has many variations, and there is surely no singularly 'best' way to do it. The critical elements of a design practice include basic problem observation, recognition of physical affordances and risks, and the willful desire to put your idea out there as the best solution.

Design has an improvisational quality, and thrives on intuitive leaps. The best decisions are often felt' more than 'known.'

	-   Importance of Design Thinking in problem-solving
	-   Overview of the lecture
- The Design Thinking Process
	-   Empathize: Understanding the users and their needs
	-   Define: Defining the problem
	-   Ideate: Generating ideas to solve the problem
	-   Prototype: Creating a physical or digital representation of the solution
	-   Test: Testing and evaluating the solution
- Design Thinking Methodologies
	- Human-centered design, Double Diamond process, Lean Design, Design Sprint, Agile Design, Systems Thinking, and Service Design are all design thinking methodologies, but they have some key differences in their approach, focus and application.
	- **Human-centered design** is a user-centered approach that emphasizes understanding the needs and wants of the users through research and empathy, and creating solutions that meet those needs. It puts users at the center of the design process, and it is iterative, meaning that the design process is repeated until the best solution is found. It requires a deep understanding of the user's context, behavior and motivations, and it is often used in projects that involve creating new products or services.
	- **The Double Diamond process** is a design thinking process that includes four stages: Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver. The first two stages, Discover and Define, are focused on understanding the problem and identifying the user's needs. The next two stages, Develop and Deliver, are focused on creating and implementing solutions. The Double Diamond process is often used in projects that require a high degree of innovation and creativity, it is a flexible and adaptable process, and it allows for the exploration of different ideas.
	- Lean Design** is a design thinking methodology that is focused on creating solutions that are customer-centered, efficient, and fast. It emphasizes the use of a Build-Measure-Learn cycle, where solutions are rapidly prototyped and tested with users, and then refined based on feedback. It is a fast-paced, iterative process that is often used in projects that require rapid prototyping and testing, such as digital products or services.
	- Design Sprint** is a five-day process for solving problems and testing new ideas, developed by Google Ventures. It involves bringing a team together to brainstorm, prototype, and test solutions in a compressed time frame, and it is often used in projects that require fast-paced, collaborative problem-solving.
	- Agile Design** is a design thinking methodology that is based on the Agile development methodology. It emphasizes flexible, iterative, and incremental design and development, with a strong focus on collaboration and continuous feedback. It is often used in projects that involve complex and rapidly changing requirements, such as software development.
	- Systems Thinking** is a design thinking methodology that focuses on understanding the relationships and interactions between the different elements of a system, and designing solutions that take these interactions into account. It is often used in projects that involve complex systems, such as organizational design or urban planning.
	- Service Design** is a design thinking methodology that is focused on designing and improving the interactions and experiences between customers and businesses or organizations. It involves a user-centered approach and an understanding of the whole service experience, from the customer's perspective.
	- Each of these methodologies has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of which methodology to use depends on the specific context
