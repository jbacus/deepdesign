# I'm a meta-designer.
Some of the things I have designed are in my portfolio: https://bacus.org but I've designed a lot of things in my life that don't fit in such a neat box. 
- I've also designed system architectures, business models, organizations, sales bundles, and marketing campaigns for Trimble Navigation.
- I've designed user-generated content communities used to populate maps with rich 3D building data for Google Earth and Maps.
- I've designed 3D modeling software for architects and others who need simple-to-use spatial sketching tools as a member of the SketchUp startup team.
- I've designed buildings, including the one we're in right now.

# I'm (re)designing this class
To me, "design" is an elusive term, and one which bears rethinking as often as possible. This is my first time teaching Design Foundations, and I'm giving it my own spin. Together, we're designing a Design Foundations class.
In previous semesters, I've taught a course in Product Management for folks who are interested in designing products. 
Last Spring, I taught a class in Digital Sketching. I wrote a book about that, too.

# What even IS design?
I've shared some of the things I have designed, and maybe given you a sense for the breadth of things I think of as being part of "design." But what do you think? Knowing what you know today, how would you define "design?"

Take a few minutes to write down your personal definition of design. Don't use ChatGPT. ;-)

>Design refers to the process of creating a plan or proposal for the creation of a product or system, often with the goal of improving or optimizing its function, form, or aesthetic. It can refer to the planning and development of a wide range of products, such as architectural designs, engineering designs, fashion designs, and graphic designs. It often involves a combination of creativity, research, and problem-solving skills, and can be applied in fields such as architecture, industrial design, graphic design, and user interface design.

# What do I think design is?
Design is the assertion that there is something about the world which should be changed combined with the will to propose a better alternative. Design is the willful drive to make something better of the world.

"Questions about whether design is necessary or affordable are quite beside the point: design is inevitable. The alternative to good design is bad design, not no design at all."

— Douglas Martin, on Twitter

The [Pyramid of Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser "Pyramid of Djoser") at [Saqqara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara "Saqqara"), 2667–2648 BC, by [Imhotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep "Imhotep"), the most famous [step pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid "Step pyramid") of Egypt

Traditionally, "design" was inseparable from "craft." Everything that was made showed the unique hand if its maker. "Designers" were inseparable from the things they created. This is one of the earliest examples of a designer whose name we know, the architect “Imhotep.”

Industrial Revolution. (2023, January 10). In _Wikipedia_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution

Two of England\'s contributions to ceramic history were creamware and transfer-printing, which revolutionised ceramic decoration worldwide. Creamware was cheap, durable and well-suited to dinner and tea services. It was hugely popular between 1765 and 1820. Transfer-printing, perfected around 1750, enabled manufacturers to achieve high-quality decoration at a low cost.  
  
Made at Josiah Wedgwood\'s factory; transfer-printed in Liverpool by Guy Green (died 1799)

## The impact of the Industrial Revolution on design
- Mass production: The introduction of new machinery and techniques allowed for the mass production of goods, leading to a decrease in the cost of production and an increase in the availability of goods. This change led to a new era of consumerism, where design became an important tool for differentiating products and attracting customers.
- The rise of the consumer culture: With the growth of industrialization and mass production, consumer culture emerged, and design became an essential tool for differentiating products and attracting customers. Designers were hired to create new products and improve existing ones, making design an important profession.
- Design for function: The Industrial Revolution led to a focus on design for function, as manufacturers sought to create products that were efficient and easy to use. This led to the development of new forms of design, such as ergonomic design and design for disassembly.
- New materials: The Industrial Revolution led to the development of new materials, such as iron, steel, and glass, which opened up new possibilities for design and construction.

---

### The rise of the professional "Designer"
The Industrial Revolution led to the rise of the profession of design, as manufacturers began to hire designers to create new products and improve existing ones. The role of the designer as a problem-solver and creative agent in the production process was established.
- The rise of design schools: In the 19th century, several design schools were established, such as the Bauhaus and the École des Beaux-Arts in France, which aimed to train designers in the skills and knowledge needed to create functional and aesthetically pleasing products.
- The establishment of design societies: Professional organizations for designers were established, such as the Society of Arts in London and the American Institute of Architects, which aimed to promote the interests of designers and raise the standard of design.
- The emergence of design patent laws: In the 19th century, several countries introduced design patent laws, which allowed designers to protect their designs from unauthorized use. This helped to establish the profession of design and recognize the value of design as a form of intellectual property.
- The rise of design journals and publications: In the 19th century, several design journals and publications emerged, such as The Studio and Design, which aimed to promote the work of designers and provide a platform for discussion and criticism.
- The emergence of design exhibitions: National and international design exhibitions were established, such as the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and the Universal Expositions, which aimed to showcase the latest designs and innovations, and provide a platform for designers to showcase their work and gain recognition.

![[DieterRamsTP1Perspective.jpg]]
Dieter Rams. (2023, January 6). In _Wikipedia_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams

# Dieter Rams: ten principles of good design
1.  **is innovative** – The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.
2.  **makes a product useful** – A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could detract from it.
3.  **is aesthetic** – The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
4.  **makes a product understandable** – It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.
5.  **is unobtrusive** – Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.
6.  **is honest** – It does not make a product appear more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.
7.  **is long-lasting** – It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today's throwaway society.
8.  **is thorough down to the last detail** – Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.
9.  **is environmentally friendly** – Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.
10.  **is as little design as possible** – Less, but better. Simple as possible but not simpler. Good design elevates the essential functions of a product.
