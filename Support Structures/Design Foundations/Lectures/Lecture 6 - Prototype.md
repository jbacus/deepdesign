**Prototype:** Create a physical or digital representation of the solution, often in a simplified form.



I. Introduction

-   Overview of the design thinking process
-   Importance of the "prototype" step in design thinking

II. Types of prototypes

-   Overview of different types of prototypes (e.g. paper, digital, physical, etc.)
-   How to choose the appropriate type of prototype for your design challenge

III. Rapid prototyping

-   Techniques for creating quick and low-fidelity prototypes (e.g. paper prototyping, wireframing, etc.)
-   How rapid prototyping can speed up the design process and save resources

IV. Prototype testing

-   How to conduct user testing on prototypes
-   Techniques for gathering feedback and using it to improve the design

V. Refining the prototype

-   How to iterate on the prototype based on feedback and testing
-   How to create a high-fidelity prototype that is ready for implementation

VI. Conclusion

-   Recap of key points
-   Discussion of the ongoing importance of prototyping in the design thinking process
-   Encourage audience to practice the skills and methods presented in the lecture in their own design work.
